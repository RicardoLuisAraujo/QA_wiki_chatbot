      " Goku in the woods A young boy by the name Goku is seen rolling a tree stump down to his house while waving to some monkeys. When he gets home Goku throws the tree stump in the air to break it into firewood. After chopping wood he greets his grandfather's artifact and heads off through the woods, hunting for his next meal. While looking through the woods he decides to jump down a cliff to hunt for a Giant Fish which he catches by skinny dipping and luring it with his tail and then kills by kicking it.\n",
      " On his way back home, he is suddenly hit by the car of a girl named Bulma. Goku first thinks Bulma and her car to be monsters and ends up destroying the car. Bulma gets angry and starts shooting at him with a gun but after finding that it is not effective she quickly surrenders and reveals to Goku that she is a human girl from the city. Goku, having never seen a girl before, curiously examines her and invites her to his house for lunch.\n",
      " Goku and Bulma's first meeting Upon arriving at his house, Bulma realizes that Goku is in possession of a Dragon Ball, gets excited, and grabs it. Goku quickly takes it away from her and tells her that it was a keepsake from his deceased grandfather. She explains that the Dragon Balls can summon a dragon that grants wishes when all seven are gathered and she has already collected two of them. Bulma tries to convince Goku to give her his Dragon Ball by lifting her skirt up revealing her panties to let him touch her bottom but Goku rejects the offer. Reluctant to give up his only heirloom, Goku says that he will accompany Bulma and that she can use his ball at the end.\n",
      " Goku defeating the Pterodactyl Just before the two set off on their quest, Bulma explains to Goku that they will be able to find the Dragon Balls using a device called the Dragon Radar. Next, Bulma takes out her capsule case and uses Capsule #9 which is a Motorcycle. While heading off on the motorcycle, Bulma eventually drives the motorcycle off a steep hill and luckily lands safely— but not before frightening her and causing her to need to stop to use the bathroom.\n",
      " Before she can go, she is kidnapped by a large pterodactyl. Alerted by Bulma's screams, Goku decides to investigate and finds Bulma in the pterodactyl's grasp. The pterodactyl claims to be a friend of Bulma, which Goku believes, allowing the pterodactyl to tie Goku to a tree while he says he needs to talk with Bulma. As the pterodactyl flies off with her, Bulma yells for Goku to help him. Goku easily unties the rope using his tail and goes after them. Goku uses Bulma's Capsule Bike to get some air, before using his Power Pole to knock-out the beast mid-flight and saves Bulma before she hits the ground by throwing the pole through her sleeves, pinning her to the side of a cliff. As the chapter ends, Goku lands safely as well, only to discover a scared & humiliated, Bulma crying as she pees her pants.\n",

Inside, Goku is overwhelmed by the modern technology of lights and television. Bulma ends up smelling Goku and tells him he must\\xa0take a bath, but Goku does not know what one is.\\n Since Goku does not know what a bath is, Bulma must\\xa0give him one. While washing Goku, she discovers that his tail is real and that it can move by itself.

After being freaked out by Goku\\'s tail, Bulma decides to calm herself down by having a bubble bath. While relaxing in a bath of her own, Goku ends up ruining it by barging in and making comments about how her breasts look like a butt.\\n Bulma finding out that Goku\\'s tail is real At dinner time, Goku shows a dislike for civilized foods, such as bread, so he goes out and catches a wolf and centipede for supper, which ends up disgusting Bulma. When it comes time to get ready to bed, Goku plans on sleeping in bed with Bulma, but she makes a bed for him on the floor. While Bulma is brushing her teeth, she asks him what happened to his parents which Goku replies that he does not know but he thinks they abandoned him in the forest and his grandpa found him and kept him. When Bulma explains that she is on her quest because of Summer vacation, Goku ends up not listening and falls asleep.\\n Goku finding out that girls do not have balls Later on, after the two have gone to sleep, Goku wakes up and goes over to a sleeping Bulma in her underwear and discovers Bulma\\'s \"pillow\". Goku proceeds to lie between Bulma\\'s legs and discovers that she lacks male genitalia and is shocked because he does not know the difference between men and women. His surprise wakes Bulma, and Goku shudders \"you\\'ve lost your balls!\" Bulma, thinking Goku was talking about the Dragon Balls, rushes over to them to find that they are all intact. Afterwards, a dark shadow of a Turtle is shown approaching the house.\\n The Owl eating a mouse'}"

It is composed of 153 episodes around 20-minutes long and ran on Fuji TV from February 26, 1986 to April 12, 1989. The series average rating was 21.2%, with its maximum being 29.5% (Episode 47) and its minimum being 13.7% (Episode 110). Despite its success, Dragon Ball was overshadowed by its more action-oriented sequel series, Dragon Ball Z. Dragon Ball depicted Goku\\'s childhood, while Dragon Ball Z depicted his adulthood. Both are adapted from the same manga.\\n Title card in the original Japanese version Dragon Ball started off as a manga series called Dragon Boy. The story depicted a young boy named Tanton and his quest to return a princess to her homeland. The series was a loose adaptation of the Chinese legend Journey to the West, depicting monkey king Sun Wukong. Due to the series\\' unpopularity, Toriyama re-wrote Dragon Boy, adapting it as Dragon Ball. All the character\\'s personalities were changed except for Goku. The re-adaptation named Dragon Ball became a hit, and was later made into an anime.\\n Two initial attempts at releasing Dragon Ball to American audiences failed. The first attempt was in 1989 from Harmony Gold USA (the company that previously dubbed Robotech). It featured strange name changes for nearly all the characters, such as changing Goku to \"Zero\" and Korin to \"Whiskers the Wonder Cat\". It was test-marketed in several cities, but was never broadcast to the general public and has since been referred to as \"The Lost Dub\" by fans.\\n The second and more well-known attempt was in 1995 with only the first 13 episodes dubbed and aired in first-run syndication. This release was a joint-production between Funimation, Seagull Entertainment, and BLT Productions, with a dubbing voice cast similar to Funimation\\'s initial dub of Dragon Ball Z. These original 13 dubbed episodes were later released to home video by KidMark as \"Dragon Ball: The Saga of Goku.\"\\n The earlier 1995 dub\\'s logo, which lasted 13 episodes and also appears on some older home video releases After Dragon Ball Z became immensely popular on Cartoon Network\\'s Toonami block, Dragon Ball was re-dubbed\\xa0in English by Funimation\\'s in-house ADR studio for redistribution in the U.S. The complete original series aired on Cartoon Network\\'s Toonami from August 20, 2001 to December 1, 2003. Unlike the theme songs for Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball GT, Funimation made English versions of the original Japanese opening (OP) and ending (ED) themes for these episodes and left in the original background music (which they would later also do with their dubs of Dragon Ball Z Kai and Dragon Ball Super). Some insert (IN) songs were taken out or have talking over them.\\n The U.S. version of Dragon Ball that was aired on Cartoon Network (before that, it was aired in syndication and on NBC in select cities) had many edits done to it. Most of the edits were digital cosmetic changes, which were done to remove nudity and blood, and dialogue edits. Sometimes, some scenes were deleted altogether, either to save time or cut out strong violence.\\n For example, when Goku dives into the water naked to kick a fish he catches for dinner, a digital water splash was added on his groin; on other occasions when he is naked, he has some digital underwear added. Also, references to alcohol and drugs were removed, for example, when Jackie Chun uses Drunken Fist in the 21st World Martial Arts Tournament, Funimation called it the \"Mad Cow Attack\" (coincidentally, there was a real life Mad Cow epidemic shortly after the episode aired). Also, the famous \"No Balls!\" scene was deleted from episode 2, and when Bulma puts panties on the fishing hook to get Oolong (in fish form), they digitally painted away the panties and replaced it with some money. Also, a number of creative changes were made to the dialogue. For example, when Puar says why Oolong was expelled from school, instead of saying that he stole the teacher\\'s panties, they say that he stole the teacher\\'s \"papers.\"\\n A lot of older fans hated these changes, because they felt it was butchering the original show\\'s humor and dumbing it down. These edits, however, were necessary in order to have the show aired on TV. The DVDs do not contain these edits.\\n Aside from censorship-related reasons, FUNimation also sometimes alters dialogue in an attempt to make a scene more humorous in nature. A notable example of this was with General Blue during his fight with Krillin where his banter with the latter was altered to have him make references to Girl Scouts, the Mona Lisa, and also insulting Krillin with \"diaper man\".\\n Original author of the manga, Akira Toriyama, held a great deal of respect for the Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z animes and those that developed them. Toriyama also admired the fact that the anime had\\xa0original stories created by the animation team, and stated that he considered the Dragon Ball anime to be equal in importance to the Dragon Ball manga.[1]\\n Main article: Dragon Ball: Ssawora Son Goku, Igyeora Son Goku\\n Main article: Dragon Ball: The Magic Begins\\nA live-action version of the popular Japanese animated series. An evil king has been stealing the mystical \"Dragon Pearls\" in an attempt to possess them all. When all but one of the pearls has been stolen, the former guardians of the magic jewels decide to band together and take action. Led by a pig-headed wizard and a half-turtle martial arts master, the team takes on the king\\'s army in a desperate bid to stop him from gaining control of the pearls.\\n Made in Taiwan and released in 1991, this feature has actually been released in the US as Dragon Ball: The Magic Begins (originally titled Xin Qi long zhu Shen long de chuan shuo, or New Dragon Ball: The Legend of Shenlong). While this movie does not follow Toriyama\\'s concept exactly, it is a lot closer to it than it is to any traditional Chinese legends.\\n Main article: Dragonball Evolution\\nA live-action version of the series, made in the United States. The movie retains the basic notion of Dragon Ball, but there are several major changes in the story and characters. The movie depicts Goku\\'s training and his confrontation with Lord Piccolo.\\n Main article: Funimation Remastered Box Sets\\nIn 2009, after the release of the Remastered Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball GT Season DVD Boxsets, Funimation announced that they would begin releasing Dragon Ball in Remastered Format beginning September later that year. They are presented in their Original Aspect Ratio 4:3 and are presented in a 5 Disc Boxset. Unlike the Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball GT Sets, the Dragon Ball Sets only include a 5.1 English Voice Track with Original Japanese Background Audio and Original Japanese Mono as Dragon Ball had never had an American Soundtrack.\\n On December 28, 2010, Funimation released Dragon Ball: Curse of the Blood Rubies to DVD and Blu-ray uncut and re-dubbed with their Dragon Ball Z Kai voice cast to Region 1 DVD. A complete box set containing all four Dragon Ball Movies was released in February 2011.[2] All movies retain their original Funimation dub with the exception of Curse of the Blood Rubies.\\n Season Release Date Saga(s) Dragon Ball: Season 1\\n Sep 15, 2009 (Episodes 1 - 31)\\n Emperor Pilaf, Tournament and early Red Ribbon Army Sagas\\n Dragon Ball: Season 2\\n Nov 10, 2009 (Episodes 32 - 61)\\n Red Ribbon Army, General Blue and early Commander Red Sagas\\n Dragon Ball: Season 3\\n Feb 2, 2010 (Episodes 62 - 92)\\n Commander Red, Fortuneteller Baba and early Tien Shinhan Sagas\\n Dragon Ball: Season 4\\n May 4, 2010 (Episodes 93 - 122)\\n Tien Shinhan and King Piccolo Sagas\\n Movie Release Date December 28, 2010\\n Dragon Ball Movie 4 Pack:\\n Curse of the Blood Rubies\\n Sleeping Princess in Devil\\'s Castle\\n Mystical Adventure\\n The Path To Power\\n See also: Dragon Ball (CD)\\nThe 1995 BLT dub featured an original theme song and replacement compositions written by Peter Berring.\\n The Canadian and UK broadcasts featured different theme songs.\\n \\n'}"
