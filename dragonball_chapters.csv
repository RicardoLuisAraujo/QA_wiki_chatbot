 Goku in the woods A young boy by the name Goku is seen rolling a tree stump down to his house while waving to some monkeys. When he gets home Goku throws the tree stump in the air to break it into firewood. After chopping wood he greets his grandfather's artifact and heads off through the woods, hunting for his next meal. While looking through the woods he decides to jump down a cliff to hunt for a Giant Fish which he catches by skinny dipping and luring it with his tail and then kills by kicking it.
 On his way back home, he is suddenly hit by the car of a girl named Bulma. Goku first thinks Bulma and her car to be monsters and ends up destroying the car. Bulma gets angry and starts shooting at him with a gun but after finding that it is not effective she quickly surrenders and reveals to Goku that she is a human girl from the city. Goku, having never seen a girl before, curiously examines her and invites her to his house for lunch.
 Goku and Bulma's first meeting Upon arriving at his house, Bulma realizes that Goku is in possession of a Dragon Ball, gets excited, and grabs it. Goku quickly takes it away from her and tells her that it was a keepsake from his deceased grandfather. She explains that the Dragon Balls can summon a dragon that grants wishes when all seven are gathered and she has already collected two of them. Bulma tries to convince Goku to give her his Dragon Ball by lifting her skirt up revealing her panties to let him touch her bottom but Goku rejects the offer. Reluctant to give up his only heirloom, Goku says that he will accompany Bulma and that she can use his ball at the end.
 Goku defeating the Pterodactyl Just before the two set off on their quest, Bulma explains to Goku that they will be able to find the Dragon Balls using a device called the Dragon Radar. Next, Bulma takes out her capsule case and uses Capsule #9 which is a Motorcycle. While heading off on the motorcycle, Bulma eventually drives the motorcycle off a steep hill and luckily lands safely— but not before frightening her and causing her to need to stop to use the bathroom.
 Before she can go, she is kidnapped by a large pterodactyl. Alerted by Bulma's screams, Goku decides to investigate and finds Bulma in the pterodactyl's grasp. The pterodactyl claims to be a friend of Bulma, which Goku believes, allowing the pterodactyl to tie Goku to a tree while he says he needs to talk with Bulma. As the pterodactyl flies off with her, Bulma yells for Goku to help him. Goku easily unties the rope using his tail and goes after them. Goku uses Bulma's Capsule Bike to get some air, before using his Power Pole to knock-out the beast mid-flight and saves Bulma before she hits the ground by throwing the pole through her sleeves, pinning her to the side of a cliff. As the chapter ends, Goku lands safely as well, only to discover a scared & humiliated, Bulma crying as she pees her pants.

 Bulma's Capsule House After Bulma and Goku cross a bridge on a motorcycle, Bulma declares that they should call it a night and uses one of her capsules to make a Capsule House appear so they do not have to sleep outside. Inside, Goku is overwhelmed by the modern technology of lights and television. Bulma ends up smelling Goku and tells him he must take a bath, but Goku does not know what one is.
 Since Goku does not know what a bath is, Bulma must give him one. While washing Goku, she discovers that his tail is real and that it can move by itself. When Bulma finds out, she begins to assume that all males had tails since it is the first time she sees a boy naked. After being freaked out by Goku's tail, Bulma decides to calm herself down by having a bubble bath. While relaxing in a bath of her own, Goku ends up ruining it by barging in and making comments about how her breasts look like a butt.
 Bulma finding out that Goku's tail is real At dinner time, Goku shows a dislike for civilized foods, such as bread, so he goes out and catches a wolf and centipede for supper, which ends up disgusting Bulma. When it comes time to get ready to bed, Goku plans on sleeping in bed with Bulma, but she makes a bed for him on the floor. While Bulma is brushing her teeth, she asks him what happened to his parents which Goku replies that he does not know but he thinks they abandoned him in the forest and his grandpa found him and kept him. When Bulma explains that she is on her quest because of Summer vacation, Goku ends up not listening and falls asleep.
 Goku finding out that girls do not have balls Later on, after the two have gone to sleep, Goku wakes up and goes over to a sleeping Bulma in her underwear and discovers Bulma's ""pillow"". Goku proceeds to lie between Bulma's legs and discovers that she lacks male genitalia and is shocked because he does not know the difference between men and women. His surprise wakes Bulma, and Goku shudders ""you've lost your balls!"" Bulma, thinking Goku was talking about the Dragon Balls, rushes over to them to find that they are all intact. Afterwards, a dark shadow of a Turtle is shown approaching the house.

 Goku thinking Bulma turned into a turtle Bulma is getting ready to continue her quest for the Dragon Balls. Goku is impatient with her, because she takes too long brushing her hair, stating, ""if you were any slower, you'd turn into a turtle"". Bored, Goku goes outside to train by breaking rocks with his bear hands. He then mistakes a sea turtle for a rock and picks it up. Goku believes that Bulma actually turned into a turtle and is confused when the real Bulma comes outside.

 Goku defeating the Bear Thief with Jan-Ken Fist Bulma tells the Turtle that the ocean is 120 kilometers away which Goku offers to take him back to the ocean. Bulma rejects the idea but Goku sets out to do so anyway. Bulma, who originally did not want to help, found herself joining in anyway since he Goku still has his Dragon Ball and that she did not want to be left out alone with Dinosaurs wandering. On their journey to the sea, the group come across a giant Bear Thief, who planned on eating Turtle. Goku easily fights him off, showing his Jan-Ken Fist attack for the first time.

Goku is given the Flying Nimbus instead but Kame-sen'nin says only pure hearted people can ride it which rejected himself. When Goku attempted to get on it worked and he flew around the beach happily.
 Bulma, who desperately wanted something, asked if she can get something too. The old hermit agreed if she will show him her panties. Bulma lifts her night gown up to show him but she did not know that Goku took them off of her earlier in the morning while she was sleeping so he saw more than we wanted. Kame-sen'nin, who got a nose bleed, decided to give Bulma something but while he was thinking Bulma spotted he was wearing a Dragon Ball and said she wanted that instead, so he gave it to her. After telling Goku that she got another Dragon Ball Kame-sen'nin got hesitant on giving it to her but that changed when she lifted her dress up again at him.
 Goku and Bulma arriving in Aru Village After the hermit left, Goku and Bulma headed back to pack the Capsule House back into its Capsule. Just before doing so, Bulma went to change her clothes but was shocked to see that her panties are on the floor. Goku admits to taking them off of her while she was sleeping so she got mad and pulled out a machine gun and shot him, and threatens to kill him if he ever does so again. Just before they head off, Bulma still wants to rise the nimbus, but Goku reminds her that she needs to be pure hearted, which she angrily assures Goku, and proceeds to jump on the nimbus only to be rejected and fall to the ground, leaving her crushed to know that she isn’t pure hearted, and forced to continue to depend on her capsules.
 Three days later, Bulma finds out that the Dragon Radar indicates that they are close by to the next Dragon Ball. They discover Aru Village up ahead which is where it should be so they decide to go into to town which they find to be suspiciously empty.

""Kame Kame Kame Kame Kame Chameleon"" (亀仙人のかめはめ波！！, Kame-Sen'nin no Kamehameha!!, lit. ""Kame-Sen’nin’s Kamehameha!!"") is the fourteenth chapter of the Dragon Ball manga.
 The cover features Bulma with a Shotgun on her back and Oolong riding on a Pterodactyl following Goku who is on the Flying Nimbus.
 Roshi fires his MAX Power Kamehameha After arriving at Fire Mountain, Master Roshi decides to put out the flames himself but first lectures the Ox-King of his misdoings of killing people over treasure at which the Ox-King bows down and apologizes, promising to change his ways. Just before getting ready to put the flames out he brings Goku and Bulma to the side and discusses the deal that in exchange for putting the fire out, Bulma must allow him to touch her breasts, which Bulma unhappily agrees to.
 Roshi prepares to destroy the flames by removing his shirt and Turtle Shell revealing what looks to be an old weak upper body. While he is comically trying to climb a wall to stand on, he receives help from Goku. While standing on top of the wall Roshi prepares for his attack which instantly turns him into a muscular giant and shoots his signature attack, the Kamehameha straight at the flaming mountain. After the attack is finished, everyone is amazed but it is revealed that Master Roshi had also destroyed the castle and mountain.

 After Master Roshi fires The Original Kamehameha at Fire Mountain in an attempt to put out the fire, he also destroys the Ox-King's castle by mistake. After this Roshi then reminds Bulma of the favor Goku said she would do (if he was to put out the fire on Fire Mountain, he then would be able to ""poke"" Bulma's chest). Bulma then went over to Oolong begging him to shape shift into a form looking like herself, and have him do it. Oolong agrees, but when Roshi comes over to receive his favor, Oolong lets him do much more with his chest as a punishment to Bulma. Goku is still amazed by Roshi's Kamehameha wave, and asks if he can be taught to do it also. Roshi explains it is a technique hat takes 50 years to learn. Goku then walks over to the car Yamcha had given Bulma, Oolong, and Goku. Goku then copies the way Roshi did the Kamehameha wave and manages to cause serious damage to the car by blowing out the tires and dent the car immensely. Then Ox-King gives them a new car, and the search for the Dragon Balls continues.

 Monster Carrot, rather than being hostile, offers to shake Bulma's hand. Yamcha immediately remembers his power, but Bulma slaps Monster Carrot's outstretched hand before he can do anything. Bulma turns into a carrot. Outraged, Goku jumps out of the car to attack. Oolong quickly cautions him to use the Power Pole so that he will not get turned into a carrot as well. Seeing that his magic touch will not work, Monster Carrot threatens to bite into Bulma if Goku continues to attack. Oolong takes the opportunity to flee.
 With his threat still in place, Monster Carrot orders his two mob members to beat up Goku. Yamcha and Puar decide to come to the rescue; Puar turns into a bird and steals Bulma from Monster Carrot's hand while Yamcha defeats the Rabbit Mob members. Able to fight back freely, Goku smacks Monster Carrot on the head and forces him to turn Bulma back into a human. Finally, Goku uses the Power Pole to take Monster Carrot and the Rabbit Mob members to the moon to make marshmallow treats for children. It is important to note that absolutely nothing suggests this means the moon is made of marshmallow, to say so would be baseless.
"
Who's Got My Balls?!,18,"Goku, Bulma, and Oolong are again driving through the mushroom forest. Oolong, curious to know why she wants the Dragon Balls, asks Bulma what her wish will be. Bulma tells him she will wish for the world's greatest boyfriend, which Oolong does not think is worth the trouble. Meanwhile, Mai is watching the car from atop a mushroom, and radios to Shu to attack. Shu quickly totals the car using his Pilaf Machine, and steals the suitcase containing five of the group's Dragon Balls.
 After a bit of prompting by Bulma, Goku chases after Shu on his Flying Nimbus. However, Shu has already left his Pilaf Machine, and the naive Goku believes that the empty vessel is the enemy that stole their balls. Goku returns and tells that he could not find the balls, but also notes that he still has the Four-Star Ball in his sack. Bulma plans to use the Dragon Radar to find the thieves' lair, but realizes that their capsules were in the suitcase as well.
 Having secretly watched everything unfold, Yamcha and Puar arrive to lend a hand, still wanting the balls for themselves. Bulma is clearly attracted to Yamcha, which scares him due to his fear of women. At his castle, Emperor Pilaf is upset because there were only five balls in the suitcase rather than six. As the Dragon Team approaches the castle, Mai notes that the last ball is coming their way. After entering through the front door and following an arrow on the ground, the Gang quickly find themselves trapped when a wall pops out from behind them.
  "
At Last... the Dragon!,19,"The cover page of the chapter (originally published with the previous chapter, as this chapter's title page was used as the cover for Volume 2) features the main characters of the saga in a circle, with the title in the middle of said circle. Going clockwise, starting at the top, the characters are Goku, Oolong, Yamcha, Shu, Emperor Pilaf, Mai, Puar and Bulma.
 Pilaf blows a kiss at Bulma The chapter opens with the gang stuck in Pilaf's Castle, where they are being monitored by Pilaf and his henchmen. As the gang bickers, Pilaf demands they hand over the Four-Star Dragon Ball. When Bulma refuses, a robotic arm comes out of the ceiling and takes her to Pilaf. Once again demanding the Four-Star Ball, Bulma continues to refuse (by giving him The Finger), warranting her a kiss blown to her by Pilaf, hoping it would frighten her into giving him the Dragon Ball. Because it had no effect on Bulma, Pilaf sends her back into the gang's cell. After reuniting with her friends, Pilaf gasses the chamber, causing the gang (as well as Pilaf himself) to fall asleep. As they sleep, Shu and Mai search for the remaining Dragon Ball, which they find on Goku's person.
 Shenron's first appearance Several hours later, Pilaf and his henchmen are outside the castle, preparing to summon the Eternal Dragon, Shenron. While they do so, Goku blasts a hole in the wall of the gang's cell with his Kamehameha, allowing them to peer outside. Hoping they can steal the Dragon Balls back, Puar and Oolong shapeshift into bats and fly out the hole just as Pilaf summons Shenron...
  "
Just One Wish!!,20,"The cover shows Puar, Oolong, Goku, Bulma and Yamcha standing in a single-file line, starting with the shortest (Puar) and going up to the tallest (Yamcha). The title of the chapter is to the right of the characters, going straight down the cover.
 Dragon Balls getting scattered The chapter opens with Emperor Pilaf and his henchmen summoning Shenron. As our heroes lose hope, Pilaf begins to make his wish, but is interrupted by Oolong, who wishes for a girl's panties. As everyone stares in shock, a pair of panties falls from the sky, landing on Oolong's face. Having granted the wish, Shenron disappears as the Dragon Balls scatter. Furious that his chance of world domination has been shattered, Pilaf imprisons the gang within a steel box with a super-reinforced glass roof. While the gang discusses searching for the Dragon Balls, Pilaf announces to them that they will die from the desert sun. As the gang panics, Goku remarks that he is hungry, ending the chapter.
"
Full Moon,21,"The cover features Goku, standing alone. The background is that of Pilaf's Castle and the moon.
 Goku turning a Great Ape The chapter opens with the gang trying to find a way out of the death trap, but to no avail. As Emperor Pilaf and his henchmen await morning, Puar notices the full moon. At the mention of a full moon, Goku tells the story of how a monster appears on nights of the full moon, and that his Grandpa Gohan was crushed by the monster (it was really Goku himself, but he has no recollection of the event). As he tells his story, the gang begins to realize it was Goku who crushed his grandfather. Just as they tell him not to look at the full moon, he does so, but nothing happens. As the gang takes a sigh of relief, the transformation sets in, causing Goku to turn into a giant ape, causing Pilaf and his henchmen to wake up. Just then, Goku breaks through the roof of the castle.
"
The End of the Tale,22,"The cover page features Great Ape Goku with Goku's martial arts clothes. The background is the same as the previous: Pilaf's Castle and the full moon.
 Great Ape Goku destroys Pilaf's Castle The chapter begins with Goku (as a Great Ape) rampaging through the castle, destroying anything and everything. Seeing their chance to escape, the gang makes a run for it, while Emperor Pilaf and his henchmen get away in a plane. However, Goku throws one of the castle's towers at the plane, sending it straight into the ground. Goku also throws a tower at the gang, who narrowly avoid it, with the exception of Bulma, who gets stuck underneath it. As Goku comes their way, Yamcha grabs his tail, stopping him in his tracks. Yamcha instructs Puar to turn into a pair of scissors and cut Goku's tail off, which causes the boy to revert to his regular form, leaving him naked.
 Yamcha and Puar cutting Goku's tail off"
Separate Ways,23,"The cover is quite plain, as it features our five protagonists, Goku, Bulma, Yamcha, Puar, Oolong, and a butterfly, and nothing else.
 Goku saying bye to his friends As the chapter opens, morning has arrived. The gang is sitting in the desert as Goku awakens, having no recollection of the previous night. He asks where the Power Pole is, which Yamcha directs him in the direction of the ruined castle. As the boy races towards the decrepit building, Oolong brings up the gang will probably split up because the Dragon Balls are unusable for another year. As Yamcha and Bulma contemplate not having their wishes granted, they decide to move to the city together. They ask Goku (who had returned after retrieving the Power Pole) to join them, but he declines; he plans on going to Master Roshi's to train. Goku remarks that they should search for the Dragon Balls together after the year is up, but Yamcha and Bulma no longer need them. Wanting the Four-Star Dragon Ball, Goku asks how he is supposed to search for it, which Bulma gives him the Dragon Radar for. As they say their good-byes, they promise to meet up someday. Yamcha, Bulma, Puar and Oolong depart in Yamcha's ship, while Goku takes off on the Flying Nimbus. Goku makes the remark that there are many different people in the world, which is where the chapter ends.
"
The High Price of Education,24,"The cover features Master Roshi driving a one-wheeled motorcycle. In the background, Goku is watching Roshi as he rides the Flying Nimbus.
 Goku arriving at Kame House The chapter opens with Goku flying towards Master Roshi's house, in the hopes of being trained by the man. After stopping at his own house for supplies, he continues his journey towards Kame House. When he arrives, Roshi is watching an aerobics video, not taking notice of the boy outside his house. Goku lets himself in, having to yell in Roshi's ear before he notices the boy. Goku tells the man why he is there, but he shrugs him off and tells him that there is food in the refrigerator. After his aerobics video was complete, he found Goku at the foot of the fridge, having eaten all the food. They then begin discussing Goku's training; Roshi tells Goku that his training is not free, so he must find a cute girl before he will train him. Goku takes off on Nimbus, while Roshi gets ready for his would-be date. When Goku returns, he has brought an overweight, muscular woman, much to the chagrin of Roshi.
"
A Rival Arrives!!,25,"The cover page features Master Roshi in a car, while Goku is on a hovercar alongside him. The cover is in color, and uses a red-gray-black color palette.
 Krillin's first appearance The chapter begins with Roshi discussing with Goku what kind of girl he wants the boy to bring him. After being shown a picture of Roshi's type, Goku sets off again, hoping to please Roshi this time. When he returns, Goku is revealed to have brought a beautiful woman to Kame House. Roshi, who is ecstatic, explains that Goku's first step into training is to get the woman's panties. However, the woman tells him she is only wearing a shirt, causing Roshi to get a nosebleed. Forced to show Goku how it is done, Roshi walks up to the woman, who turns out to be a mermaid. Roshi then asks if he may touch her breasts, which she replies with a swift punch to the jaw. Roshi turns this into a training lesson, in that you must take punches to get stronger.
 As they discuss getting a third woman, Goku spots a boat near the shore with a boy on it. The boy jumps out of the boat, but ends up getting his head stuck in the sand. After Goku helps pull him out, he introduces himself as Krillin and requests for Roshi to train him. Although Roshi declines the request, Krillin hands him a Dirty Magazine, forcing him to change his mind. However, he must find a pretty woman along with Goku before he takes him on as his student. As Krillin jumps onto the Flying Nimbus, he falls through the little cloud, causing him to explain his intentions of training: to be popular with girls...
"
Who's That Girl?,26,"The cover features Launch, the newest addition to this ensemble, on a motorcycle. In the far background, Goku is riding the Flying Nimbus.
 Launch being chased by the policemen The chapter opens with Goku and Krillin riding the Flying Nimbus in search of an attractive woman. As they fly, Goku spots a ""woman"" he believes Master Roshi would like (unbeknownst that it is a man), which Krillin promptly scolds him over. They then begin a discussion about telling the difference between males and females.
 Meanwhile, a young, blonde-haired woman is being chased after by policemen. To get them off her tail, she throws a grenade at them; she manages to stop one of them, but the other is still on the prowl. She then goes up a cliff, where she loses the policeman in the rock formations. However, they track her down and attempt to take her into custody. Just as she is about to fire her shotgun at them, one of her hairs brush her nose and she sneezes, causing her to change into a blue-haired gal.
 Back with Goku and Krillin, they are discussing if there is a girl in the cliffs they are flying over.
 At the scene of the police chase, the police are about to take her into custody, but the woman (who they refer to as Launch) has no recollection of the events that transpired moments ago. Frightened, the woman screams in horror, a scream that can be heard by Goku and Krillin who are directly above her. The boys contemplate whether helping her is safe or not, but Goku does not care; he jumps right in and gives the policemen a wallop. After defeating the officers, the boys decide to take Launch with them to Roshi's, believing he will be satisfied with this gal.
"
Nothing to Sneeze At,27,"The cover features Launch in a maid's outfit (dark dress and white apron), with Goku, Krillin and Master Roshi, all on a Flying Nimbus, staring at her in the background. This cover was used in the third ""Romantic Ageru Yo"" ending version of the Dragon Ball anime, albeit with different coloring for Launch's dress and apron.
 Master Roshi sees Launch for the first time The chapter starts where the last ended, with Launch being saved by Goku and Krillin. As Launch asks where they are taking her, Goku points out Kame House, their destination. Upon reaching the small island, they cannot find Roshi. As Goku goes to look for the old man (who was in the bathroom), Krillin and Launch begin to discuss why she was being chased by the police, but Roshi interrupts. The geezer proceeds to flirt with Launch, who is oblivious to the man's intentions. He then asks her if she would like to stay at Kame House; an offer she quickly accepts. He also offers to train her in martial arts, and gives her a uniform she must wear. As she is about to undress in front of the three males, Krillin comments on it, making her go inside to change, much to Roshi’s chagrin.
 Launch sneezes, causing Bad Launch to appear After she returns, she, as well as the others, are wearing women's lingerie. Just as they begin training, a fly touches Launch's nose, causing her to revert to her blonde-haired persona. Having no recollection of the three men before her, she grabs her machine gun and fires, and sneezes again, which forces her back to her blue-haired personality. The chapter ends with Launch asking if she did anything bad, which Roshi replies with an ""of course not.""

""Let the Training Begin!"" (修業はじまり！！, Shugyō Hajimari!!, lit. ""The Training Begins!!"") is the twenty-eighth chapter of the Dragon Ball manga.
 The cover page features Master Roshi and Goku inside a hovercraft, as they look to the right of the page.
 Kame-Sen’nin announces to everyone that they are going to move to a larger island for their training. After everyone is finally outside, Kame-Sen’nin puts Kame House in a capsule. Goku thinks they should travel using Kinto-Un, but Kame-Sen’nin says they will go by boat instead. The four of them hop into a hovercraft, and Kame-Sen’nin tells Lunch not to sneeze. When they arrive at the island, Kame-Sen’nin says they will try until dinner, but Goku has already hopped on Kinto-Un to takes an aerial look at the island. He finally comes back and reports that there are other houses on the island. Kame-Sen’nin says there are three hundred people living here. Lunch wonders what she should do while everyone else is training. Kame-Sen’nin tells her to do as she likes, and so she decides to prepare dinner. She suddenly looks as though she is about to sneeze, and the boys freak out and run behind a rock. It turns out she was just yawning, and wishes them well while she makes dinner.
 Krillin, Goku, and Roshi terrified that Launch is seemingly about to sneeze Before they start things, Kame-Sen’nin asks Kuririn if he knows anything about martial arts. Kuririn says he spent eight years at the Ōrin Temple training. Kame-Sen’nin decides he wants to see what their true strength. He wants to know how many seconds it will take them to run a hundred meters. Not for speed, but to test the solidity of their legs. Kuririn decides he will run it first with his Olympic-capable feet, and he clocks in at 10.4 seconds. Kuririn chuckles about his best being 10.1, and then Goku goes. Goku clocks in at 11 seconds, but asks if he can change his shoes and run again. Kuririn thinks he is making excuses, since his shoes are not made for running either, but Goku shows that his are all broken (his toes are sticking out). With new shoes, Goku runs again, and clocks in at 8.5 seconds.
 As Kame-Sen’nin takes his turtle shell off his back, he tells them they need to overcome the human barrier to become perfect martial artists. He then asks Kuririn to time him. Kame-Sen’nin runs it, and asks for his time, and Kuririn says 5.6 seconds. Kame-Sen’nin is not that impressed by the number, and puts his turtle shell back on. He figures that since they are young, they should be able to easily beat five seconds, with training. Then he asks Goku to get him a beer, but Goku does not know what that is, so Kuririn goes. Meanwhile, Kame-Sen’nin tells Goku he will also need intelligence in martial arts. Lunch sneezes while Kuririn is retrieving the beer, and chases him outside with a butcher knife. While hiding behind a rock, Kame-Sen’nin tells Goku that Kuririn is now really close to reaching the human barrier.
"
Bad Day at Turtle Rock,29,"The cover page features Goku with a pilot's cap on his head, his Power Pole in his right hand and a monkey in his left.
 Krillin tricking Goku The chapter opens with at dusk, where Master Roshi telling Goku and Krillin that they will start their real training at the crack of dawn the next morning, but decides to start it at that moment. Roshi then draws a kanji on an ordinary rock, which he quickly chucks into the jungle below, where they are to go searching for it. He explains that this is to test the boys' stamina, and that the loser will not get dinner. He also sets a time limit, thirty minutes, or neither will get dinner. Wasting no time, Goku jumps off the cliff they are on, landing safely by grabbing onto a tree branch.
 As Goku searches the jungle, Krillin finds an ordinary stone and draws the same kanji Roshi drew on that rock. He takes it back to the hermit, who promptly throws it the liar's head. He demands Krillin find the real one; as he frantically searches for the stone, a wild cat attacks him. He quickly defeats it, but narrowly avoids a triceratops. He soon hears Goku, who has found the stone. Tricking the naive boy into handing the stone over to him, Krillin takes off towards Roshi, intent on being the victor. The two have a brief scuffle, with Goku coming out on top; however, Krillin tricks the dimwitted Goku again by throwing a fake stone in the opposite direction, allowing him to bring the original stone to Roshi.
 At dinner, Goku is forced to watch the other three dine, but they end up having food poisoning. That is where the chapter meets its end...
"
Milk Run,30,"The cover features multiple Gokus in several different fighting stances.
 Master Roshi and his disciples having a light jog The chapter starts in the next morning, where Master Roshi is waking everyone up. Goku is sleeping in Launch's bed, who is currently blonde. Frightened, the hermit attempts to wake Goku up as carefully and quietly as possible. As Goku awakens, he greets Roshi, causing Launch to wake up as well. Angry that he was in her bed, Launch shoots at the young boy. Refusing to back down, Goku kicks the blonde in her face, knocking her out cold.
 Later on, Roshi, Goku and Krillin are outside. Roshi teaches the boys about what martial arts is about, which he follows with a light jog. After making their way into a town-like area on the island, they stop at a humanoid cow's house, who Roshi had promised the day before to deliver milk to the inhabitants of the village. After climbing a large amount of stairs, they arrive at the house of a monk who tells them of the World Martial Arts Tournament. After a brief discussion about the tournament, the boys deliver the rest of the milk; upon finishing, Roshi declares that their morning training is over.
"
It Only Gets Harder,31,"The cover page features Master Roshi and Krillin in a car, while Goku rides atop it. In the background is a field, with a house and windmill in the corner.
  
The chapter opens with Goku and Krillin working in a field. Roshi tells them they cannot use the hoes they are currently using, but they must use their hands. After a short while, the two are finished, and they go off to eat breakfast.
  Once they finish their breakfast, Roshi sits them down and tells them they must train their minds, as well as their bodies, to become master martial artists. He asks Goku to start reading, who, surprisingly, know how to read perfectly.
 At 12:30 PM, they decide to take an hour nap. After finishing their nap, they begin construction work, which they finish in minimal time. Once that is complete, the boys are to swim for their training. Fed up with training, Goku asks Roshi to teach them how to fight. He tells them he cannot unless they can move a large boulder beside him. When Krillin doubts that such a feat is possible, the hermit quickly demonstrates that it is. After telling the boys that they can do this too if they train everyday, Goku easily moves it (even farther than Roshi). To cover up this embarrassment, Roshi lies and says that's the wrong rock, and a much bigger rock, one that Goku cannot move, is the real one. As they ask for him to move it, he tells them to go back to their training, implying that he cannot move it himself.
  
When they return to the lake, Roshi instructs the boys to swim to the other side of the lake and back ten times. However, there is a shark in the lake, but the two manage to pass the test.
  For their next segment of training, the two are tied to a tree, which has a beehive on it. After Roshi hits the hive, dozens of bees swarm the boys.
 Once back at Kame House, Roshi tells the boys, who have welts all over their bodies, that their training for the day is over. Krillin asks if they are gonna train like this everyday, which Roshi replies to with a yes. As the chapter ends, the hermit gives the boys twenty pound Turtle Shells to wear, which causes Krillin to fall over.

Hard Work Pays!!



""Let the Contest Begin!!"" (天下一武道会はじまる！！, Tenka'ichi Budōkai Hajimaru!!, lit. ""The Tenka’ichi Budōkai Begins!!"") is the thirty-second chapter of the Dragon Ball manga.
 The cover features Goku and Krillin, jumping in the air. They are both wearing Turtle School Uniforms.
 The chapter opens with the boys delivering milk throughout the island; this time, however, they have the Turtle Shells on their backs, making the training more challenging. As the months rolled on, their training has gotten much easier, with them being able to finish tasks in record time.
  
With one month before the World Martial Arts Tournament, the boys show Master Roshi that they can move the giant rock now, much to the shock of the Turtle Hermit. Roshi then explains that the boys are not entering the tournament to win, but to demonstrate the training they have acquired the last seven months. After that, he gives them forty pound shells, doubling the weight they must carry.
  As the final month passes, the boys, along with Roshi, are about to embark to South City. After taking off the turtle shells, the hermit asks the two youngsters to jump as high as they can, which is at least two stories high. Now more excited than ever before, Goku and Krillin get into suits to Roshi's own and board an airplane for the city. After taking a taxi to the tournament grounds, the three martial artists finally reach their destination: the World Martial Arts Tournament.
"
Hard Work Pays!!,33,"The cover page features Goku climbing a tree, while Krillin sits on a stone wall and Master Roshi looks behind him towards the reader. The cover is in color, and uses a red-black color palette.
 The chapter begins with Master Roshi guiding Goku and Krillin to the preliminaries. Since only fighters are allowed in, Roshi bids ado and gives the boys each a pair of fighting outfits, each with his insignia on the left chest.
 Roshi gives Goku and Krillin Turtle School uniforms Once in the room that the preliminaries are being held in, Krillin begins to have doubts about the tournament. The announcer of the preliminaries states that 137 people have entered the tournament, meaning that it will be a trying day for all participants. After he announces the rules of the round, each fighter must draw a number out of a box, which will place them in one of four divisions.
 As everyone has drawn their number, the another announcer yells out Goku and a large, Russian fighter's numbers. The match begins, with Goku going through the man's legs. Looking around for the little fighter, the man falls out of the ring, making Goku the winner. Goku jumps out of the ring and tells Krillin not to go all out unless he is up against a powerful opponent. As he tells Krillin this, the monks of Orin Temple come over and pick on him. One of them reveals that he will be fighting Krillin, much to the chagrin of the little boy.
 The next match is between Krillin and the bully monk from earlier. When the man comes into attack, Krillin jumps over him and kicks him in the stomach, sending the bully through the wall, making Krillin the victor.
"
Strongest Under the Heavens!,34,"The cover page features Bulma and Oolong in a car as Goku flies next to them on top of the Flying Nimbus.
 The chapter opens with Goku and Krillin continuing on through the elimination round of the World Martial Arts Tournament. At the start of Krillin's second match, Goku distracts him, allowing his opponent to land a hit on him. After getting up from the attack, Krillin scares his opponent into forfeiting, making him the winner.
 As the end of the elimination round draws near, Krillin cheers Goku on while Yamcha stands behind Krillin, smiling as he watches Goku effortlessly defeat his opponent. As Krillin begins his match with Fighter 97, Yamcha reveals to Goku that he made it past the preliminaries. Krillin easily defeats Fighter 97, gaining a spot in the top 8. Yamcha then tells Goku that Bulma, Oolong and Puar are at the tournament too.
 Meanwhile, Master Roshi meets Bulma, Oolong and Puar.
"
The Battle is Set!!,35,"The cover features Goku, Krillin and Yamcha running towards the reader.
 The 21st World Tournament matches are determined The chapter opens with Goku and Krillin running through the labyrinth of people towards Master Roshi, Bulma, Oolong and Puar. They all have a happy reunion, and Goku tells Roshi that they made it into the tournament. As the announcer calls for the eight participants to gather, Roshi runs off, causing Oolong to ponder where he went.
 In an undisclosed location, the eight fighters all gather, awaiting further instructions. The announcer arrives and splits them up into groups of two; these pairs will make up the first round of battles. A man named Nam is pitted against a woman named Ranfan (Battle #3), Krillin is put up against a disgusting fighter named Bacterian (Battle #1), Goku is to fight a monster named Giran (Battle #4) and Yamcha against a mysterious name named Jackie Chun (who is really Roshi in disguise; Battle #2). The chapter ends with the announcer about to call the first battle: Krillin vs. Bacterian.
"
Match No. 1,36,"The cover page features Krillin and Bacterian, the fighters in the first match. Below their boxes are the other six fighters, who's battles are in later chapters.
 The chapter begins with the World Tournament Announcer telling the audience that the winner will receive 500,000 zeni. After a brief greeting from the high priest of the dojo, the announcer declares the first match of the tournament: Krillin vs. Bacterian.
 Krillin is victorious over Bacterian As the match begins, Bacterian makes the first attacks, which Krillin easily evades. Bacterian uses disgusting tactics to defeat Krillin, such as making Krillin smell his breath, burping, and touching Krillin after touching his privates. As Krillin falls down in disgust, the announcer begins the countdown; to force him to stay down, Bacterian farts on his opponent's face. As the count nears ten, Goku shouts to Krillin reminding him that he has no nose, so he cannot smell his gross opponent. With renewed confidence, Krillin attacks his opponent, but Bacterian begins spitting at Krillin. Krillin easily dodges the spittle, kicks Bacterian to the ground and then farts in Bacterian's face, defeating him.
"
Match No. 2,37,"The main portion of the cover (underneath the Dragon Ball logo) shows Master Roshi and Yamcha, who face off in the 21st World Martial Arts Tournament during the chapter. The other six tournament finalists are shown in smaller panels at the bottom of the cover. Bacterian has an X over his face to indicate that he has already been eliminated.
 The chapter opens with Krillin and Goku celebrating the former's win over Bacterian. The pair search for Master Roshi in the crowd but cannot find him, despite Goku smelling him nearby. They leave the ring, and the next match between Jackie Chun and Yamcha is announced. Bulma wonders if Jackie is cute. Jackie Chun commends Krillin on his fight before heading to the ring. Yamcha wonders where the mysterious Jackie Chun is from, having never heard of him.
 Yamcha charges at Jackie Chun with his Wolf Fang Fist Once the fight starts, Yamcha immediately notes Jackie Chun's confidence, and decides to attack first to see how he counters. He unleashes a series of punches and kicks, all of which Chun dodges with ease before chastising him for wasting movements. Goku, watching the match, calls Krillin over excitedly. Oolong worries about Yamcha's chances, and Puar is somewhat nervous as well. Yamcha is surprised, but decides to unleash his signature Wolf Fang Fist. Chun nimbly dodges this attack as well. He then approaches the stunned Yamcha and creates a gust of wind with his arm, knocking Yamcha out of the ring and winning the match. Goku, Krillin, Yamcha, the announcer, and the crowd are all stunned, and Krillin nervously notes that Chun is his next opponent.
"
Water and Cheesecake,38,"The main portion of the cover (underneath the Dragon Ball logo) shows Nam and Ranfan, who face off in the 21st World Martial Arts Tournament during this chapter. The other six tournament finalists are shown in smaller panels at the bottom of the cover. Bacterian and Yamcha have Xs over their faces to indicate that they have been eliminated.
 As the chapter begins, Goku is surprised that anyone could beat Yamcha so easily, while Krillin is nervous about having to face Jackie Chun next. As they leave the stage, Yamcha congratulates Jackie, who notes that Yamcha is young and will only improve. Yamcha is about to mention Chun's resemblance to Master Roshi, but is cut off by the World Tournament Announcer announcing the next match: Nam vs. Ranfan.
 Nam defeats Ranfan using his Shura Gekiretsuken Jackie Chun jokingly notes to Nam that he wanted to fight the attractive Ranfan, but Nam is unmoved, leaving Chun to wonder how Nam can be so focused during such a ""glorified carnival."" Reading Nam's mind, he sees that Nam has come to the tournament to win money to buy his water for his drought-stricken village. As the match begins, Ranfan flirtatiously winks at Nam before launching an aerial kick followed by a strike to the back of the head, both of which connect. An enraged Nam strikes back, but Ranfan screams as he approaches, causing him to instinctively stop his blow and simply tap her arm. Ranfan drops to the ground screaming that she has been hurt. While Nam apologizes, Ranfan attacks again. The stunned Nam declares that he will no longer view her as a woman.
 However, Nam's declaration is short-lived. Ranfan dodges his next attack, then takes off her top and pants and seductively walks towards a blushing Nam. Jackie Chun is ecstatic, leading Yamcha to conclude that he is indeed Master Roshi. Nam backs away from Ranfan until he reaches the ring's edge, at which points Ranfan attacks. Nam closes his eyes, dodges, and delivers a blow to the back of her neck, knocking her out cold. The chapter ends with Jackie Chun looking over Ranfan's body, ostensibly to assess her injuries.

Monster Smash,39,"The main portion of the cover (under the Dragon Ball logo) shows Goku and Giran, who face off in the 21st World Martial Arts Tournament during this chapter. The other six tournament finalists are shown in smaller panels at the bottom of the cover. Bacterian, Yamcha, and Ranfan have Xs over their faces to indicate that they have been eliminated.
 Giran uses his Merry Go Round Gum technique on Goku The chapter begins with the announcement of the fourth match of the tournament: Giran vs. Goku. Giran promptly enters the ring and roars, but Goku does not come out. Krillin, Nam, Yamcha, and Jackie Chun are all worried that Goku will miss his chance to fight. Giran declares that he should win by forfeit as the crowd grows restless. However, Ranfan soon finds Goku sleeping against a wall, and Krillin drags him over to the ring as he wakes up.
 The match then begins, and Giran distracts the childish Goku before kicking him into the arena wall. Everyone thinks Goku is defeated, but he quickly gets back up, stunning Giran. Goku then charges in to attack, and manages to punch Giran in the stomach then throw him by his tail. Giran sails out of the ring, but uses his wings to fly back in. Goku readies himself to fight again, but Giran unleashes his Merry-Go-Round Gum, much to the shock of Goku and his friends. The chapter ends with Goku ensnared, unable to move.
"
The Tail of Goku,40,"The cover shows a picture of Goku in a fighting pose, with the World Martial Arts Tournament arena in the background. The cover is in color, with a red-brown-gray-black color palette.
 Giran surrenders upon witnessing Goku's raw strength The chapter opens with Goku still ensnared in Giran's Merry-Go-Round Gum. As Goku attempts to escape, Giran says that the gum will become stickier the more he struggles. Giran punches Goku's head, then picks him up to throw him. Goku demands that Giran fight fair and square. Giran hurls Goku out of the ring, much to the consternation of his friends. Goku calls for the Flying Nimbus, which comes to his rescue, taking him back to the tournament ring. Giran complains that Goku's use of the Nimbus breaks the rules. The announcer, after conferring with the head priest, decides that he will allow the Nimbus to be used this time only. Giran is undaunted, as Goku is still trapped in the gum. He winds up for a monster punch, but is stunned when he misses. He soon sees that Goku has dodged by using his tail, which conveniently grew back at that moment, to swing on Giran's own tail. Goku's friends are flabbergasted by the sudden occurrence. Giran amazedly declares that Goku cannot be human. Goku then bursts free from the gum, then checks out his strength by kicking a large hole in the arena wall, noting that he is now much stronger (due to the tail). Giran, terrified, holds up a white flag to concede the match. Bulma nervously wonders when the next full moon is.

Kuririn vs. Jackie Chun,41,"The cover shows Goku flying in a small one-seater airplane, looking down at the ground below. The helicopter has a shark face painted on the front, 41 (the chapter number) on the side, and ""Dragon Ball"" written on the tail fin.
 Krillin on the offensive against Jackie Chun The chapter begins with Goku still on stage after his victory over Giran, who is seen leaving. The announcer calls Krillin on stage as well to interview the pair. Krillin asks Goku why he never mentioned his tail before, and Goku simply says that it had fallen off. The announcer asks Goku his age, but Goku is confused as to the purpose of his microphone. Goku figures out that he is 12 rather than 14, as he previously believed. The crowd finds the pair, and Goku in particular, amusing. The announcer asks if Goku's tail is real, and Goku moons him to show that it is. Finally, he asks the two what martial arts dojo they are from, and Krillin responds they are from the Turtle School. This stuns both the announcer and the crowd, as Master Roshi is apparently known as the ""God of Martial Arts.""
 Offstage, Yamcha accuses Jackie Chun of really being Master Roshi, noting their similar facial features, skill as fighters, and love of women. Chun denies that he is, and leaves when he is called out for the next match. Taking the microphone from the announcer, he performs a quick song-and-dance number, with Goku joining in the dance. Finally, the match begins, and Krillin leads off with a furious charge. Chun dodges all his blows before blocking his last one, noting that Krillin is making him work. However, Chun hits Krillin with his first punch, knocking him into the wall. Goku and Yamcha are stunned, and Krillin uneasily notes that he could not even see the strike.
"
The Big Fight,42,"The cover depicts Jackie Chun, Goku and Krillin in fighting stances. Jackie Chun is mentally visualizing an attractive woman from one of his exercise videos, while Goku and Krillin comment seriously on the stance. Goku asks where he learned it, while Krillin claims that the stance ""leaves no openings!""
 The chapter begins with Krillin sitting against the arena wall, lamenting that he did not see Jackie Chun's last punch coming. Goku, leaning over the wall, notes that he did. The crowd as well as the World Tournament Announcer are confused as to what happened. Krillin gets back up to fight, and focuses closely on Chun. Chun makes a move and Krillin claims that he sees it this time, and the two clash quickly before jumping apart.
 Krillin tricks Jackie Chun with a pair of panties The announcer asks what happened but gets no response, and Krillin and Chun both attack, ostensibly clashing quickly once again. However, after they both land this time, Krillin falls face-down, seemingly having been hit. The announcer begins his count, but Krillin manages to get up after he reaches eight. Chun thinks to himself that Krillin really did take his training seriously. However, before they can continue their fight, the announcer interrupts, asking what happened during their last exchange. Chun and Krillin walk him through a complicated sequence involving several strikes and a game of rock-paper-scissors, which he cannot believe all happened in so short of a time.
 Krillin hits Jackie Chun with a hard kick to face The fight resumes, and Krillin unleashes his secret weapon: a pair of panties, which he tosses on the ground. Jackie Chun predictably leaps down after them, and Krillin uses this opportunity to kick Chun and send him flying. This causes Yamcha to change his belief that Chun is really Master Roshi, as he believes Roshi would have never lost his concentration.
"
The Mysterious Jackie Chun,43,"The cover page features Jackie Chun and Krillin about to engage in battle on the World Martial Arts Tournament stadium, with Goku watching from the stone wall.
 Jackie Chun knocks out Krillin The chapter opens with Jackie Chun falling out of the sky. Seeing no other way to stay in the tournament, he uses the Kamehameha to keep him in the ring. The attack surprises Krillin and the onlookers, who question seeing the technique before. As Jackie Chun prepares to end the match, Krillin attacks. However, Jackie Chun easily evades the attack, causing the boy to smash his head into the gate of the ring. Chun jokes with Krillin, aggravating the boy. He attacks again, but Chun appears behind him and chops both sides of his neck, causing Krillin to fall to the ground. The countdown reaches ten, forcing Krillin to forfeit the match.
 After the match, Yamcha tries to prove that Chun is Master Roshi in disguise. He attempts to rip his hair off, but this proves to fail. He then asks Goku to smell Chun, as his nose is as sharp as a dog's. He does so, but Chun is wearing cologne, blocking Roshi's real scent. Just then, the announcer calls Goku and Nam to the ring, as their match is about to begin. The chapter ends with Yamcha thinking about whether or not Chun really is Roshi or not.

 Goku and Nam face off The chapter opens with Goku and Nam's battle beginning. Goku attempts to use the same move Jackie Chun used against Krillin, but Nam evades and almost kicks Goku, but the boy dodges just in the nick of time. After the two throw kick after kick and punch after punch, Goku manages to land a hit on his opponent, which sends him flying towards the gate. However, Nam propels himself off the gate and chops at Goku's neck, causing him to fall to the ground. As Nam is about to push the boy out of the arena, Goku uses his tail to trip Nam, allowing Goku enough time to get up.
 Nam performs the Cross Arm Dive Debating on how to fight against Nam, Goku tries a new move where he spins at a speed too fast for Nam to attack. Nam soon realizes Goku's trying to push him off the side of the arena. Just as Nam gives up hope, Goku falls over in dizziness, no longer able to spin. Nam almost falls over the edge, but he barely hangs on, which allows him to jump into the air and attempt the Cross Arm Dive, a powerful attack. As he closes in on Goku, the announcer yells for Goku to wake up. This is where the chapter ends.

 Goku jumps past Nam The chapter begins with Goku waking up just as Nam lands on him using the Cross Arm Dive. Nam asks the announcer to start the countdown, which he does. As the countdown is happening, Nam explains that he will not kill Goku, but he will be asleep for ten days. Just as the countdown reaches ten, Goku manages to rise, shocking everyone in the vicinity.
 Nam falls out of the arena Once the shock has cleared from his system, Nam attempts the technique again, sure it will finish him this time. Seeing his opponent jump into the sky, Goku tags along. As Nam begins to dive, he sees Goku zoom passed him. Upset that he jumped too high, Goku falls back down to Nam's level. Tired of the insanity of the match, Nam attempts to end it by hitting the boy with the Cross Arm Dive again; however, Goku reaches the ground before his opponent and kicks him square in the chest, sending him out of the ring. Goku is declared the winner! Yamcha and Krillin are excited for Goku, but Jackie is a little worried.

When Nam questions how Chun knew about his dilemma, he reveals that he is Master Roshi in disguise and can see into the hearts of others. He then goes on to tell him that he entered the tournament under the name Jackie Chun as a way to test Krillin and Goku. As the final of the tournament commences, Yamcha continues to badger Chun about being Roshi in disguise. Annoyed, he points towards the audience, with Roshi (really Nam repaying the favor) standing clear as day. Convinced, Yamcha allows Chun to go begin his match. That match starts, with the last panel showing Chun moving to attack his opponent.
"
The Kamehameha,47,"The cover features Master Roshi in three different outfits: Jackie Chun, the Turtle Hermit and normal Roshi.
 The chapter opens with Chun rushing Goku. However, the boy jumps into the air, evading his opponent. Chun gives chase, hitting the boy square in the back, which sends him flying out of the arena. As Chun is about to be declared the winner, Goku appears; he is using his tail as a propeller to fly. Upon his return to the ring, the two martial artists discuss using the Kamehameha, and Chun decides to show Goku that not just anyone can use the powerful technique. As Chun begins charging the blast, so does Goku, who fires his at exactly the same moment the hermit does. The blasts collide, sending both fighters back, although unharmed. As everyone stares in disbelief, Chun decides on his next move.

 Goku acts like a crazy dog The battle between Jackie Chun and Goku continues, with Chun appearing behind the boy and kicking him towards the gate, smashing a part of it in the process. However, Goku remains unscathed, much to the chagrin of Chun. Goku then uses Chun's own technique against him, even surprising him by taking the attack one step farther and appearing above him, allowing him to smash Chun's face to the ground. Chun accuses Goku of disrespecting his master, but quickly covers up the verbal blunder. He then goes back to attacking Goku.
 Chun displays a drunken fighting style, which Yamcha recognizes as the Drunken Boxing Technique. He yells to Goku to be careful, but it is to no avail; Chun begins to beat down on the boy. Just as he looks like he is going to pass out, Goku begins acting like a monkey. He viciously attacks Chun, smashing him to gate (as Chun had done earlier to the boy). When asked what technique that was, Goku replies by saying it is the Crazy Monkey Technique.

 Chun starts to move his hands in a strange manner and sing a lullaby. It is the Sleepy Boy Technique. Goku falls asleep. The World Tournament Announcer is not sure if it counts as martial arts, but Chun claims it is because ""It has a fancy Chinese name, doesn't it?!"" The announcer begins to count as Goku's friends yell to try to wake him up. When the announcer is about to say ""ten,"" Bulma yells ""DINNER TIME!!!!"" causing Goku to wake up and run around looking for dinner. Goku is told he will get dinner after the match and decides to end the fight quickly. He hits Chun by saying ""Paper,"" but doing ""Rock,"" in his Rock, Scissors 'N' Paper. Chun decides he has no choice. He'll have to use ""that move.""

 Jackie Chun decides he has no choice but to use ""that move."" Although, he doubts Goku would die from it. Jackie Chun states the move he is about to perform was has only been performed on a human being once before, Grandpa Gohan. This shocks Goku, knowing Jackie Chun fought with his grandfather. Jackie Chun claps his hands together and powers up for the attack. After a few moments, his hand begin to emit electricity. Then, Jackie Chun fires electricity out of his hands to Goku, which lifts Goku in the air. Yamcha tells Krillin that this is the Thunder Shock Surprise, which uses energy as 20,000 volts of electricity. Jackie Chun tells Goku to give up, seeing as even Grandpa Gohan could only make it this far. Goku says ""I...Give..."", but suddenly, he sees the Moon. His eyes turn red as he transforms into a Great Ape.

Yamcha tells Puar to transform to a pair of scissors and that while Yamcha is holding his tail, Puar can cut it off. Jackie Chun then takes off his shirt and powers up. He forms a MAX Power Kamehameha. Yamcha runs to Jackie Chun, warning him to not do this because it will kill Goku. Jackie Chun fires the MAX Power Kamehameha. It shows everyone in a bright flash of light. The Kamehameha wave clears. Everything seems the same, but Great Ape Goku is missing. Jackie Chun breathes heavily as he returns his muscles to normal. Yamcha goes back to the gang and says that Goku did not make it.
"
The Climax Approaches!,52,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku holding his Power Pole while riding a plane.
 The announcer starts to declare Jackie Chun the winner, while Krillin screams out that he is a murderer. Jackie points over at some rubble, where Goku's lying naked and everyone is shocked to see he is still alive. Jackie explains that what he blasted with the Kamehameha was not Goku, but the moon. The announcer looks up and is astonished to see the moon is missing from the sky. He starts going on about how there will be no more eating dango (Japanese dumpling made from rice flour) by the moonlight, wolfmen will not be able to transform, elegance and crap are all gone...
 The World Tournament Announcer notes that the moon has been destroyed by Jackie Chun Jackie yells at him to stop blathering and make the count, but Goku gets up at two. He wonders why he is naked, but no matter. Goku faces Jackie again, and Jackie is mad that his Kamehameha used up all of his energy. Goku is still naked, so the announcer puts the match on hold, and asks Goku if he could put some clothes on before continuing. Kuririn climbs in the ring and says he will give him his dougi. The two head backstage to change and Kuririn puts on his old Oorin Temple outfit.
 Jackie Chun prevents himself from touching the outside of the ring Goku is hungry as he gets back into the ring, noting that his strength has also reduced. Jackie tries a finisher Kamehameha, but he is too pooped out, and nothing happens. Goku realizes that if Jackie can not use the Kamehameha anymore, he can not fly either. Goku unleashes his own Kamehameha, and Jackie just barely avoids it. Goku takes the opportunity to jump kick Jackie. Goku lands, and Jackie falls outside of the ring. Everyone thinks Goku has won, but Jackie tells everyone to look; it is not a ring out. He has his left foot in the side of the ring, and he is a few inches above the ground. So, the match will continue. Jackie tells Goku the rest of this match will be hand-to-hand combat, and the stronger one will be the victor. Goku refuses to lose, while Jackie contemplates Goku's small body, which gives him a realization. Jackie and Goku both dart towards each other.

Goku gets up first, but says only ""Y...yep....I....wo....."" before collapsing, to everyone's shock. Sentence fragments are not allowed, so they do not allow it.

The Red Ribbon,55,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku flying the Flying Nimbus, with Colonel Silver to the side. The Four-Star Dragon Ball is seen floating around.
 Some time has passed since the 21st World Martial Arts Tournament. Goku flies through the air on Kinto-Un in a wooded, mountain-ish area, and he stops at a river for a drink. He checks the Dragon Radar Bulma gave him, and there is a Dragon Ball just to the northeast. Meanwhile, at two Capsule Houses with a pickup truck (a Ford) outside, a cowboy has just woken up. Another guy in a trench coat, wearing a scarf around his neck, tells him it is already 8:00, and the cowboy greets him as Colonel Silver. Silver tells the cowboy to get off to work, and so the cowboy gets in the truck with a fox guy. Silver says that Commander Red wants them to find ""it"" quickly. Brown Company already found one yesterday. The truck drives off, and Silver reveals to us that the thing they are looking for is a Dragon Ball.
 Colonel Silver yells on his men The cowboy digs through some bushes, angry about having to search for a small ball in such a big area. The fox guy spots something coming. Goku comes whooshing in, hops off of Kinto-Un, and checks the Dragon Radar. Goku looks around, and the two guys tell him to get out of the way or they will kill him (the cowboy has a gun out). Goku walks over and finds the Dragon Ball between two rocks. ""This has six stars, so it is the Six-Star ball. Not Grandpa's…"" The two guys think that must be the Dragon Ball, and Goku asks how they know about them. The cowboy points his gun at Goku and tells him to hand it over. Goku asks what he is planning to do with it. The cowboy tells him to hand it over if he does not want to die, but Goku sticks his tongue out at him. The cowboy tries to snatch it, but Goku kicks him off into the distance. The fox guy starts firing at Goku, but Goku dodges the bullets and jumps over towards him. He punches him in the gut, and kicks him off into the distance as well.
 Colonel Silver blasts Goku off his Flying Nimbus Goku picks up the Six-Star Ball and flies off, while the cowboy guy slumps over to the truck and radios Silver. Silver runs out of one of the houses with a missile launcher, and fires at Goku. It is a direct hit. Goku lands safely, although Kinto-Un is destroyed. Goku is pissed, as Silver asks him about his radar and why he is gathering the Dragon Balls. Goku says he is not telling anything to him because of what he did to Kinto-Un. ""Kid… Don't mess with the Red Ribbon's Captain Silver…""
"
The Dragon Ball Scramble,56,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku flying in a plane piloted by a capsule robot with Red Ribbon Army symbols on its wings.
 Goku does not know what the Red Ribbon Army is and does not care. Colonel Silver steals Goku's bag containing the Dragon Ball he just found and the Dragon Radar, but Goku takes it back. This prompts Silver to happily start fighting, but he gets trashed very easily by Goku. Since the Flying Nimbus no longer exists, Goku decides to try using one of the RR capsules. The first one gives him a service robot which tells him what capsule to try second. This gives Goku an airplane that the robot then flies for him.
 Commander Red In the Red Ribbon Headquarters, Commander Red is talking to his aide about getting all of the Dragon Balls. A minion runs into state that one of the Dragon Balls is moving towards Colonel Silver's Camp. After repeated tries, they get Silver on the radio and are told about Goku. They suspect that ""the brat"" has a Dragon Radar like they do. The Dragon Ball is moving into the arctic region, towards General White, and he is to be told to kill the kid.
 Back in the airplane, Goku is freezing and the Red Ribbon Robot tells robots do not feel the cold. The Dragon Ball is below them when the robot crashes the plane.

The Red Ribbon Army has kidnapped Jingle Village Chief in their attempts to find the Dragon Balls themselves. Goku reassures the two that he is just trying to find his grandfather's Dragon Ball when two men find the trail leading to the house and break in. After quickly trashing the two soldiers, Goku rushes out to rescue the headmaster from Muscle Tower and soon rushes back in, suffering from the cold again. After dressing in the girl's winter clothes, he finds out that the white stuff outside is called ""snow."" He thinks it is weird stuff. The girl thinks that Goku is a weird boy, and her mother would hate for him to die.

 While trying to figure out where Jingle Village Chief is, General White comes over the PA to ask what Goku wants.

All this fighting makes Goku hot, so he takes off the winter gear. He heads up to the third floor. Both General White and Ninja Murasaki are impressed, but the ninja claims that although Major Metallitron will probably win, there is no way the intruder can get by his 4th floor command. Major Metallitron points out the stairs to the next level, and then states that Goku has to get past him first. Goku's early attacks leave him thinking that the Muscle Tower is not a challenge and yells out ""Fighto"" in victory.

 Goku wins the race, much to Ninja Murasaki anger and General White's annoyance On the next level, Goku is stunned to find a forest growing inside a building. Then, throwing spikes hit the ground in front of him. Ninja Murasaki boasts about his skills as a ninja and tells us that Goku is going to die very quickly. While Murasaki is bragging about his invisibility, Goku picks up a rock and throws it into the trees. Murasaki decides to try this a second time, throws out a smoke bomb, and challenges Goku to find him. Goku does this with no trouble, because the ninja has grabbed the wrong piece of camouflage (the American flag). So, Murasaki makes one last go at hiding from the boy, telling him to count to thirty before coming to find him. Goku can not remember what comes after 18 and catches Murasaki trying to sneak under a fake rock. Murasaki complains that Goku has ruined his best ninja technique. Goku agrees that the fake looks just like the real thing, but still wants to know what comes after 18. The ninja gets up to 23 before saying that counting is not one of the techniques required by ninja. He tells Goku to just count up to 30, which Goku succeeds at on the second try. This time, the whistling of the air through a reed gives the over-confident ninja away. Murasaki complains that Goku had almost killed him with the hot water poured down the tube, before challenging Goku to a foot race. Murasaki uses caltrops to gain an edge, but Goku responds by wearing wooden geta, and outdistances his opponent. Watching all this from a monitor the final floor of the Muscle Tower, General White thinks that Murasaki has the power but not the intelligence.

 White yells at Murasaki over the PA system, so Murasaki decides to get serious. He pulls out his katana (sword), and tells Goku he is going to die. Murasaki jumps up into the air to attack Goku, but Goku plants the Nyoi-Bō in the ground so it is sticking up and backs away. Murasaki lands on Nyoi-Bō, which goes up his ass as he comes down. Murasaki runs around screaming, and Goku laughs, saying that he has a tail now too. Goku finally pulls it out and Murasaki clutches his ass while Goku laughs some more.
 Ninja Murasaki lands on the Power Pole painfully Murasaki is really pissed, and grabs his katana and swings at Goku, but he blocks it with Nyoi-Bō. Goku starts coming at Murasaki, who just barely holds off the Nyoi-Bō with his katana. Until Goku takes one hard swipe down and breaks the blade off the katana. Goku says it is no match for his Nyoi-Bō. Murasaki throws his broken katana down and suggests they fight with bare hands. Goku puts Nyoi-Bō away, and Murasaki throws a curved blade at him, but Goku jumps over it. Goku says he’s dirty for lying, but Murasaki insists this is a game of life-or-death. Then the blade comes back and hits Goku in the back of the head, knocking him out, and Murasaki calls it his Boomerang Shuriken.
 Goku and Ninja Murasaki battle Murasaki celebrates his victory while White compliments him over the PA system, until Goku starts to get back up. Goku says his head really hurts now, and Murasaki can’t believe it. Goku, now very angry, starts chasing him, and so Murasaki throws some shuriken back at him. But they hit the tree Goku ducked behind, and he pulls them all out so he can return them, as Murasaki runs into the house. Goku comes in after him, and prepares to throw the shuriken as Murasaki kneels confidently over the tatami floor mats. Goku throws one, and Murasaki catches it with one of the tatami mats. This is his Ninpō Tatami Gaeshi (Ninja Arts Tatami Counter). Two, three, four, and a fifth shuriken caught with a half-size tatami, then Murasaki laughs. But there are no more tatami, and so Goku throws his sixth shuriken right into Murasaki's forehead. Murasaki says it would have been better if he would had six whole ones instead of four and a half.
"
The Ninja Split!,62,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku driving a car, with a passenger in the back holding a gun.
 Goku is chasing Murasaki around outside again, but when they get near a lake Murasaki throws another smoke bomb at Goku. When the smoke clears, Murasaki is wearing snowshoe-looking things on his feet so he can walk across the water. This is his Amenbo no Jutsu (Water-walking Technique). Goku doesn’t see what the big deal is, and Murasaki calls across from the other side that there’s piranha in the lake. Goku says he’s not limited to getting across by swimming, and he jumps all the way across to the other side. Murasaki asks if he’s a frog, and Goku asks if they’ll fight for real this time.
 Murasaki starts whistling, and he announces his Bunshin no Jutsu (Art of Division). There are now five Murasaki’s, and they’ve got Goku surrounded. Goku looks around, thinking they all look real, until one of them throws some kunai at him. Thinking he has found the real one, Goku runs after him, but then another Murasaki cuts in front of him with a katana. Goku prepares to attack him, when a third Murasaki starts firing at him with a revolver. Goku thinks they all look real, and one of the Murasaki’s says it’s because they are all real. They are quintuplet ninjas!
 Goku gets it now, and the five of them come at him, intending to cut him up like raw fish. They all swing at him, but Goku uses Zanzōken, and they’re only hitting an afterimage. The Murasaki’s realize the brat can use real a “Art of Division”. The real Goku whacks one of them in the head with Nyoi-Bō, then kicks another in the face, knocking them both out. Another one yells to be careful, while Goku knocks out the remaining two. The last Murasaki can’t believe this, so he runs up to a higher part of the room. He comes to a cage, and yells inside at Artificial Human No. 8 to come beat up this brat. Goku catches up, and No. 8 looks big and scary.
"
Mechanical Man No. 8,63,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku in a fighting position with Android 8 towering over him.
 Murasaki opens the cage, and No. 8 comes out while Murasaki laughs about how strong he is. He tells No. 8 to kick the brat down and beat him to death, but No. 8 refuses. Murasaki yells at him, but No. 8 still refuses. Murasaki exclaims that the Red Ribbon Army created him, and can’t believe he would refuse to listen to the word of his parents. No. 8 insists he can’t, so Murasaki prepares to make him listen. He pulls a remote controller out of his shirt, and says there’s a bomb in his body, just for an instance like this. All he has to do is press the switch to make No. 8 blow up. Nevertheless, No. 8 insists he can’t do bad things. White thinks he’s a traitor and a failed creation, and yells at Murasaki to blow him up. So, Murasaki distances himself, and prepares to push the switch. But then Goku charges over, whacks the controller out of his hand, and smashes it. Goku then hits Murasaki with a Janken Gū, and Murasaki flies into the wall, knocked out.
 Goku knocks the remote controller out of Ninja Murasaki's hands Goku balances along the railing over towards No. 8, who thanks Goku. Goku tells him you have to fight bad guys, though it is not good to kill them. No. 8 admits that he’s scared of fighting. No. 8 then asks him his name. “I’m Son Goku. You?” “I’m called Artificial Human No. 8.” Goku thinks that whatever-No. 8 is a weird name. No. 8 asks if he’s here to help the village elder. Goku says yeah, and there is no time to waste. No. 8 offers to lead the way to the highest floor, as thanks.
 Goku and Android 8 fall through a trap door They head upstairs to a maze of a room, and Goku asks “Hatchan” if this is the fifth floor. No. Android 8 says this is between the fourth and fifth floors, and asks about “Hatchan”. Goku says whatever-No. 8 is too hard to say, and No. 8 likes that name. (Hachi is Japanese for “eight”, so Hatchan = “hachi” plus “-chan”.) They come to a flight of stairs, and as they ascend, Hatchan explains that through this wall is the fifth floor. It’s a secret room with no entrance, and even he doesn’t know what’s inside. And now at the top of the stairs is the highest floor, the sixth floor control room. Goku busts through the door, and demands that the elder be returned. White congratulates him on making it this far and Hatchan insists that he give in. White says they’re the ones who should give in, and presses a button. Goku and Hatchan suddenly fall through the floor, into the secret room on the fifth floor…
"
The Horrible...Jiggler!,64,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku looking confused at a picture of himself and Bulma on a television screen. Puar, Yamcha, Bulma and Oolong are standing around him.
 Goku lands safe on his feet, and then Hatchan falls down on top of him. They both realize this is the mysterious room on the fifth floor, and White looks down from the trap door and laughs at them. He says to give up the Dragon Ball and the radar if they want out of there, but Goku refuses. So, the trap door closes, and White says he’ll watch them die through the monitor. Hatchan asks Songoku (he always says it like a single word) if he is also gathering the Dragon Balls for bad stuff, and Goku explains about Grandpa’s memento. Hatchan is glad to hear that.
 Buyon appears A wall opens up in the room, revealing a huge, fat, drooling, blobby monster. White announces that this monster, Buyon, is going to eat them, and Hatchan is scared. Goku figures he can beat this guy in one hit, though White insists that nothing can affect Buyon. Buyon swipes his huge tail at Goku, but Goku jumps over it, then kicks off the wall and flies at Buyon with a punch to the face. But Buyon is all rubbery, and Goku's fist gets stuck in his face, then plops out, and Goku bounces back to the floor. Goku can’t believe his punch was ineffective, so he tries a kick this time. But Goku just bounces off of Buyon’s stomach face first into the wall.
 Buyon fires his Antenna Beam Goku does not know what to do, and then Buyon shoots some lightning out of his antennae, shocking Goku. Buyon then rolls out his long monster tongue, grabs Goku with the tip, and rolls his tongue back into his mouth to inhale Goku. But Goku manages to pry open Buyon’s mouth and hop out. Hatchan is very happy to see him safe. Buyon tries shocking Goku again, but misses. Goku’s worried, since he does not know how to beat him. He decides to try a Kamehameha, but it just bounces off Buyon’s stomach and Goku’s really at a loss now.
"
How to Unjiggle a Jiggler,65,"The cover of this chapter shows Buyon and Goku.
 Buyon freezes from the intense cold from outside Goku is really worried, and then White calls out that he will give him another chance to give up the Dragon Ball and radar, but Goku still refuses. White tells Buyon to kill them, and he rolls his tongue out again, this time grabbing Hatchan. But Goku runs over and kicks Hatchan free just in the nick of time. This time, Goku flies straight at Buyon with a headbutt, but he just gets bounced back face first into the wall again. Goku’s at a loss, and tries to think of what to do again. He suddenly remembers Suno explaining what it means to be frozen, and Goku declares his victory.
 The frozen Buyon cracks and breaks apart Goku confidently walks over to the wall and punches a hole in it, letting the cold in. Goku quickly runs away shivering, and hops into Hatchan's jacket. Goku hides in there for a while as the cold blows in, until Buyon is frozen solid. Goku hops out of Hatchan’s jacket and runs over, kicks the frozen Buyon, and runs back into Hatchan's jacket as Buyon shatters. Goku hops out of his jacket again, and jumps straight up through the ceiling, into the sixth floor. White can not believe this. Goku pulls out his Nyoi-Bō and makes it extend down the hole so Hatchan can grab onto it, then makes it retract to pull Hatchan up. White fires at Goku with a revolver as it retracts, and they are direct hits. But the shots just make Goku mad, and he tells the worried White how much they hurt. Goku tells him to give back the village elder or he’ll knock him out!
"
Muscle Tower's Final Hour,66,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku, Oolong and Puar leaning on a square containing various activities.
 General White threatens to shoot the village chief Goku keeps demanding White return the elder, but White takes off his sweater and prepares to fight. White swings at Goku, but Goku ducks and lightly kicks White in the shin. It hurts, and White is mad now. White does the old “look over there” trick, and punches Goku in the gut while his head is turned. It doesn’t bother Goku, though, and Goku decides to show him a real punch. White bounces off the ceiling and lands behind his control desk. While back there, White spots his Powered Gun, and smirks.
 Android 8 stops General White from shooting Goku White stands up and admits defeat, then goes into the next room and lets the elder free. Goku tells the elder that he and Hatchan are there to save him, and he beat up all of this bad guy's friends. Then White pulls the Powered Gun out of his back pocket and puts it to the elder's head, and Hatchan begs him to stop. Goku says that's dirty and White laughs at his misfortune. Then, the elder suddenly shouts out that he does not mind dying; just beat this guy up and bring peace to the village. Goku decides to do just that, but the elder says, “B-but… If you could, I’d be happy if you could rescue me as well…”
 An angry Android 8 attacks General White White tells Goku to turn around, and so Goku does just that. White then fires off the Powered Gun, hitting Goku in the back of the head, and knocking him out. Hatchan screams “Songoku!!!!” as White laughs with glee. White prepares to fire off a finishing shot at Goku, but Hatchan runs in the way and takes the shot himself, unaffected. Hatchan is really pissed now, and he puts his anti-violence policies aside to punch White straight through the tower wall, way out into the snow. Hatchan picks up Goku, who’s sore, but not dead, and explains how he wasn’t really hurt by the shot since he’s an Artificial Human. Goku, Hatchan, and the village elder all head down to the base of the tower back toward the village, with Goku complimenting Hatchan’s strength on the way down. As they come outside, Goku says he’s hungry, and they all laugh as they tread though the snow.
"
"Go West, Young Goku",67,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku and a young cavewoman riding a dinosaur with a prehistoric-like background.
 It’s dark outside, and everyone’s eating at Sno’s house, with Goku inhaling everything. Sno’s dad is home now, and he and the elder are grateful to Goku and Hatchan for what they’ve done. Sno’s mom mentions the Dragon Ball, and Sno’s dad says they never did find it, and wonders where it is. Hatchan says he has it, and takes the Two-Star Ball out of his pocket. Sno’s dad asks why he has it, and Hatchan says he found it when he went outside, but kept it hidden because General White said that he’d kill all the villagers once it was found. At that, the elder says that he really likes them, and invites Goku and Hatchan to come live at his house. Hatchan’s worried, though, since he’s an Artificial Human, but the elder says how even if he was a real human, bad guys are bad guys.
 Hatchan tears up and says he’s really happy, then asks Songoku if he’ll live with them, too. Goku says he can’t, since this ball isn’t Grandpa’s memento. Hatchan thinks he’ll be lonely, but Goku says they’ll surely meet again someday. Sno’s mom thinks the boys should stay here for the night, and then the elder heads off, saying Hatchan can come live with him starting tomorrow. The kids are all in Sno’s room now, with Hatchan and Goku in futons on the floor. Sno thinks the Dragon Balls are pretty, and Goku says she can have them. But Sno doesn’t want them, in case the Red Ribbon Army comes back. So, Goku will hold on to them, and he puts them in his little sack with the Dragon Radar. Hatchan asks if that’s the radar that General White kept talking about, and Goku says this guy named Bulma gave it to him. Goku tries clicking the top to see where the next ball is, but nothing happens, and Goku thinks it must’ve got broken while he was fighting. Hatchan wants to take a look, but it’s too complicated for him to fix, so Goku thinks he’ll have to go to Bulma’s house to get it fixed.
 Goku and Android 8 Goku thinks he remembers that Bulma lives in ‘West City’, but doesn’t know which direction it is to get there. Sno says that she thinks it is “that way”. Hatchan says that it is incredibly far to get there, and wonders how Goku will do it. Goku decides he’ll just walk, and everyone wishes him good luck. They all go to sleep, and Hatchan thinks sleeping in a futon feels good.
 “The next morning…” All the villagers are outside now, and Goku’s bundled up in winter clothes again. Sno’s dad is surprised to hear he’s walking, and Goku explains how Kinto-Un got all broken. “What!? Kinto-Un, you say!?” asks an old guy, wanting to know if Goku can ride Kinto-Un. Goku asks how he knows about Kame-Sen’nin’s Kinto-Un, and the old guy explains that there used to be a bunch of those when he was a kid. The elder affirms that, and says there haven’t been any people around here with good hearts to ride them anymore. The old guy asks if he’s tried calling it since it got broken, and Goku hasn’t, since he thought it died. So, Goku calls, and Kinto-Un whooshes in, and Goku happily hugs it. Then he says goodbye to everybody, and zooms off toward West City.
"
Monkey in the City,68,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku smiling and holding the Power Pole.
 Goku arrives in West City, impressed with its size and busyness. He hops off Kinto-Un, and starts wandering around. He ends up out in the middle of traffic where a guy in a car yells at him. Goku asks the guy where Bulma's house is, but he doesnot know (or care), and drives off. Then Goku asks a lady with a baby carriage where Bulma's house is. She doesnot know either, and she tells him to ask somebody else. Goku cannot believe that she doesn’t know even though they live in the same place. A taxi comes by, and Goku hails it down, and the driver tells him to hop in. The driver asks where to, and Goku says Bulma's house, so the driver asks where that is. “I don’t know. I’m searching!” The driver halts the cab and asks if he has money for this, but Goku does not, so the driver throws him out on the street. Goku realizes you need money to find out where someone's house is in the city.
 Goku punches the martial artist in the stomach hard He notices a crowd has gathered, and a boxer guy is fighting people; if they defeat him, they get a 100,000 Zenni prize. Goku says he will fight, and the guy thinks he is joking. Goku insists he is not, and the guy nonchalantly gives in as the crowd laughs. Goku starts by jabbing him in the stomach, sending the guy to the ground clutching his stomach. But the guy refuses to give up. Noticing the kid knows kenpō, the guy decides to get serious, and Goku jumps up and kicks the guy in the face. The guy is angry now, and he swings at Goku, but Goku ducks it. Then the guy tries to come down at Goku, but Goku jumps up and kicks at him. He hits the brick wall instead of the guy's face, though, putting a hole in it and scaring the guy into conceding and giving Goku the money.
 Goku wanders around the street holding his money, wondering who to ask, and then two bad guys in an alley spot the little bumpkin with all the money. One of the bad guys kindly calls Goku into the alley, then pulls out a gun and tells him to give up the money. Goku excitedly asks if they are going to tell him where Bulma's house is, but the other bad guy yells to quit yapping and hand over the money. Goku sticks his tongue out, and the bad guy gets mad and pulls out a knife. Goku head butts him into the wall, knocking him out, and the other bad guy humbly tells Goku to try asking a policeman where her house is.
 Goku asks a girl where a policeman is, and she points to one, and so Goku gives her all his money as thanks. Goku goes up to the policeman and asks where Bulma's house is, and the policeman asks him if he doesnot have a better description. Goku kneels down and draws a picture of her (a very bad one, at that), but that is not really what the policeman was looking for. The policeman decides to get out his computer and search for her, and thinks it shouldnot take long since it is an unusual name. The first Bulma is wrong, but the second one is her. The policeman freaks out and says this girl is the daughter of the owner of Capsule Corporation. Since it is such a long way from here, the policeman decides to give Goku a ride on his motor scooter. Capsule Corp is a huge dome building, and Goku starts yelling “Bulmaaaaa!!!”
"
Bulma and Goku,69,"The cover of this chapter shows Bulma and Goku riding on a Jet-Bike which has the number ""67"" printed on the side.
 The policeman says to try talking into the interphone, but Goku doesn’t know what that is. So the policeman calls in and asks about Bulma. A robot says Bulma is still at school, and then the policeman remembers that school isn’t out yet. Goku says he’ll wait, and tells the policeman he can go now. But the policeman says he can’t until he makes sure Goku isn’t a bad person; it’s hard to believe someone like Goku would know the daughter of the owner of a top class company like Capsule Corporation. Then Goku says he smells her, and she’s coming this way on a futuristic motor scooter thing.
 Bulma’s impressed to see that Goku found her house, and he explains that the policeman helped. Bulma asks him what he wants, and Goku says that the radar she gave him got all broken and he wants her to fix it. Bulma says that’s nothing, and tells them to come inside. The policeman also asks if he can’t also get his scooter fixed. Bulma’s dad rides in the room on a bicycle, with a little black cat on his shoulder. He hops off, and Bulma tells him this boy is who she’s told him about. So, Bulma’s dad goes up to the policeman and says he’s not the chibi he heard about; he’s really large and doesn’t look twelve. But then he sees the real Goku, and they greet each other. The policeman wonders if this is really the Dr. Brief who invented capsules. Bulma says they’re going upstairs, and asks her dad to fix the policeman’s scooter down here.
 At Red Ribbon Army Headquarters, Red and Black wonder why the enemy has gone to West City. A bear guy comes in and informs them that they received a picture of the enemy from General White. Red can’t believe that this is the brat that wiped out Silver and White. They don’t know which of the four remaining Dragon Balls he’ll be after. So, Red yells at the bear guy to send this picture to all units, and inform them to find and kill him.
 Dr. Brief's first appearance Bulma is finished fixing the Dragon Radar, and notices that Goku has only found two balls so far. Bulma decides she’ll go with him to find the Dragon Balls. Goku says she’ll just get in the way, and she yells that if she’d been with him, he’d have already found his grandfather’s Four-Star Ball. Goku asks how she plans on going, since she can’t ride Kinto-Un, and Bulma laughs and shows him her watch. It’s a Microband, and if you press this switch, it makes you small. So, she shrinks down to mouse size. And then a woman comes in and steps on her. “So, you’re Goku-chan, huh!! Nice to meet you!! I’m Bulma’s mama!!” Bulma grows back to normal size, and then her mom asks what she was doing under her foot, and Bulma yells at her.
 Bulma’s mom apologizes for her loud daughter and offers Goku some sake. Bulma yells at her for offering sake to a kid. Bulma’s mom says she’s so rebellious. Bulma’s really annoyed now, and then Goku asks about Yamcha and Oolong. Bulma’s mom says they’re all in school, but Bulma’s in a dispute with Yamcha-chan right now, since he’s popular with the girls. Bulma yells at her again, and tells her mom that she’s going to go find the Dragon Balls again and get a much better man than Yamcha. Bulma’s mom asks if she can’t come to get a good man, too, and Bulma yells that she can’t come.
 Bulma and Goku head downstairs, where Dr. Brief is working on the policeman’s scooter. While getting a capsule case, Bulma tells him that she and Goku are off to search for the Dragon Balls again. Dr. Brief tells her to get dad a lovely gal, and she yells at him about husband and wife being the same. Outside the house, the policeman watches on his scooter as Goku calls Kinto-Un. Bulma turns tiny again and hops into Goku’s shirt, and they fly off. The policeman says he doesn’t understand the rich, then turns on his scooter, and flies down the street with it. He crashes into a lady’s car with his suped-up scooter, while Dr. Brief notes that Bulma mistakenly took his capsules…
"
Bulma's Big Mistake!!,70,"The cover of this chapter shows Bulma holding a gun wearing a Camo Bikini top and cut off jeans and a combat knife strapped to her left leg. Characters such as Goku, Commander Red, and General Blue can be seen behind her in rectangular boxes.
 Goku and Bulma continue along on Kinto-Un, hoping that the Four-Star Ball is the next ball. Meanwhile, at Red Ribbon Army Headquarters, Black informs Red that the boy is headed towards the Dragon Ball under General Blue’s charge. Red’s pissed, and he yells at the bear guy to contact General Blue about this. At Blue Company’s Temporary Camp, General Blue is yelling at his troops to shape up if they don't wish to be the brunt of Red's fury, when a tiger guy says that the Dragon Ball is at the bottom of the ocean, and thus hard to get. Blue doesn’t want to hear any excuses. (Note that Blue speaks with rather feminine language in the Japanese version.) Then Blue looks over at a guy who was picking his nose, and wants him punished for being so filthy. As the guy is getting shot as well as Blue expressing a disturbing amount of enjoyment at the sound of the resulting gunshot, a fox guy reports that the kid is headed their way. An alligator guy points out to him that this kid wiped out Silver Company and White Company, though Blue dismisses the reminder by stating the two had been embarrassments to the Red Ribbon Army. Blue then thinks this will be fun, as he looks at the picture of Goku, before chuckling ominously.
 The first appearance of General Blue Bulma yells at Goku to stop, since the Dragon Ball is right below them. They are over the ocean, and Bulma says they should go over to the island so she can get a boat or something. Goku’s going to go try searching under the water and Bulma pulls out the capsule case. There’s only one capsule in there, and Bulma realizes she took her dad’s case. She decides to have a little faith in her dad, and throws the capsule… but out pops a ton of porn. Goku thinks its weird how all these people have their clothes off even though they’re not taking baths, and she yells that kids aren’t supposed to look at that. She then tears up all the magazines. Goku realizes he has to go down and search after all, and takes off his clothes, then hops on Kinto-Un and flies over to a spot above the ocean. He dives down and starts swimming towards the Dragon Ball. He swims until he can’t hold his breath any longer, and he swims back up to the surface. He hops back on Kinto-Un and flies back to the island to tell Bulma it was too deep, but she’s gone when he gets back.
 Bulma is wandering around, wondering if there is anyone here so she can buy capsules. Two jet-flyers then come by. She tries to flag them down, but they start firing at her. She starts running away, but one of the guys notices it’s not the brat, but a woman. So, the two of them land and apologize, and she asks if there’s any place to buy capsules here. Nope. But they tell her she’s cute, and ask if she wants to have fun with them. She realizes they don’t mean stuff like Famicom (Nintendo), but echii stuff. She runs away as they fire at her again, and Goku hears her screaming. Goku flies Kinto-Un past the two jet-flyers and asks Bulma if these are bad guys. They start firing at him, so he decides to fight them. First he jumps sideways through the windshield of one jet-flyer, and it crashes. He jumps over to the next one and cuts the jet-flyer in half with the Nyoi-Bō. Bulma can’t believe those guys, and Goku says he thought up something. Kame-Sen’nin’s house isn’t that far from here, and he probably has a capsule that can go underwater. Bulma’s not too thrilled about seeing Kame-Sen’nin, and Goku says he is smart, too.

The Turtle is Spotted!,71,"The cover shows Goku and Master Roshi looking toward the sky as Master Roshi does a peace sign, while General Blue spies on them from above the air in his jet-copter.
 Goku and Bulma continue along on Kinto-Un until they reach Kame House. Goku says hi to “Urigome”, but the turtle corrects him, saying his name is Umigame. Umigame calls Kame-Sen’nin out, saying Goku has arrived. So Kame-Sen’nin comes out, asking if Son Gohan's memento Dragon Ball has been found yet. Since it has not, Kame-Sen’nin asks why he is here. Goku wants Bulma to explain, so she hops out of his shirt and grows back to normal size. Kame-Sen’nin asks how she did that, so Bulma explains about how she invented this Microband. Bulma soon gets to the point and asks Kame-Sen’nin if he has a submarine capsule they can borrow. Kame-Sen’nin asks what they want it for, and Goku says the Dragon Ball is at the bottom of the ocean, and it is too far to dive down to. Kame-Sen’nin says he’ll lend it to them, and Bulma thinks that was too easy. “Provided that…” Bulma is worried now. “…you give me that shrinking apparatus.” Bulma is very relieved that that it is all he wanted. She thought he might’ve said to give her underwear, or pafu pafu. Bulma hands over her Microband, and asks for the submarine capsule, but Kame-Sen’nin says Kuririn and Lunch took it out to go shopping.
 Bulma regrows in front of Roshi using her lattest invention At the Red Ribbon Headquarters, Red wonders why the brat has suddenly stopped moving. Black thinks the kid might have comrades, one of which could be an amazing scientist that invented his superior radar. Red agrees, and realizes the place he has stopped at must be his base. He tells him to contact General Blue and have him scout out that place and find the enemy's hideout. Blue picks up the phone and receives the orders at Blue Company's Temporary Base. Still waiting for Kuririn and Lunch, Bulma asks Umigame where the bathroom is, and he says its inside on the left. Kame-Sen’nin thinks now is his chance, then yawns and tells Umigame and Goku he is going to go in to watch TV. Then once he is inside, he shrinks down and runs under the bathroom door, intending to see some good stuff. He catches Bulma with her pants down, and gets excited and hops up on the back of the toilet. But Bulma is zipping up her pants, and he can not believe she has already finished. Then he suddenly slips and falls into the bowl, and Bulma flushes it. Bulma wonders what the noise is (Kame-Sen’nin screaming) as she is washing her hands.
 Back outside, they are still not back yet, and Kame-Sen’nin crawls out from the sewer and grows back to normal. Umigame wonders why he is out here soaked instead of in watching television, and then Goku spots something. Kuririn and Lunch are back, and Goku and Bulma say hello. Kuririn calls Bulma “Pants-san“, and she yells at him that her name is Bulma. The reason they took so long was because Lunch transformed. Bulma wonders about that and Kuririn asks Goku why he is here.
 Elsewhere, one of Blue Company's jet-flyers has not found anything yet, but thinks he will soon, since there are not many islands. Back on the island, the situation has been explained to Kuririn, and he mentions pirate treasure being down there as well. Goku and Bulma wonder about that, and Kame-Sen’nin explains that they say the pirates hid their treasure somewhere down there. Bulma thinks that sounds cool, and Kuririn wants to go with them. Kame-Sen’nin gives him the okay, and Kuririn, Bulma, and Goku take off. Bulma remembers that she left the bag of Dragon Balls behind, but Kuririn insists it will be alright with Muten Rōshi. The jet-flyer spots them, and informs General Blue that it is headed towards Blue's area. It must be the brat, so the pilot decides to search the direction they came from. And the enemy base really is there: a house on a small island. Blue asks him to find out if anyone is there. “Just a woman, a turtle, and an old man.” Blue thinks the old man must be the professor who invented the radar.
"
The Blue Meanies,72,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku standing looking up at General Blue standing next to him.
 Bulma watches the radar as Krillin pilots them through the air, and tells him to dive here. General Blue is watching them from the shore with binoculars, and notices that it’s Goku, in a party of three this time. A soldier gets something through the radio, then comes out and tells General Blue that the enemy’s two Dragon Balls are still on the island. Blue thinks that really must be the enemy’s base. He tells Captain Dark that they’ll split the company into two. “A Company is under my command, and we’ll go after the boy! B Company is under your command, and you’ll attack the enemy’s base!""
 Under the sea, Bulma says its right below them, but the ocean floor below them seems to be barren. Goku says he’ll get out and look, and wonders if the scuba gear can really let him breathe in the water. Goku swims around, and spots a gap in the ground that looks deep. Bulma wants to look from the side to judge the gap’s depth. It’s very deep, so she asks Goku if there’s a way in. Goku says nope, and wishes they had the shrinking machine she gave to Master Roshi. Bulma checks the radar again, and notices that the gap goes on. She zooms out the screen to get a clearer picture, and apparently the gap continues into a cave system, from which they can enter. So she calls Goku back to the sub with the good news.
 The first appearance of Captain Dark The officer leading B Company flies his plane alongside about a dozen jet-flyers towards Kame House. Blue commands A Company in a large military submarine, which has gotten close to the enemy sub. A Hippo asks General Blue if they should attack the enemy yet, but Blue wants to wait for them to find the Dragon Ball’s location. Goku, Bulma and Krillin then spot the opening to the cave system. One of the soldiers tells General Blue they’re entering a cave, so Blue says to begin the attack. The Hippo yells out to fire the torpedoes, but they miss the little submarine. General Blue yells to fire some more, and Bulma wonders why that submarine’s firing at them. Goku thinks it might be Red Ribbon Army again, and Bulma and Krillin freak out, since the Red Ribbon Army is rather infamous. Goku explains that they’re also looking for the Dragon Balls, and so he ends up clashing with them. Krillin says they’re the worst army in the world, and they quickly duck into the cave as the second round of torpedoes heads their way.
 General Blue changes plans and gives the orders to pursue, and wants the gunman executed. The group notice they’re being chased, and Bulma yells at Goku for not mentioning the Red Ribbon Army was involved before. They keep heading down the cave tunnel, and Krillin gets excited, since there’s a smaller hole up ahead as General Blue's bigger submarine won’t fit. As the Goku, Bulma and Krillin celebrate, General Blue says they’ll head on in the smaller ships. Meanwhile, at Kame House, Turtle spots something flying their way, and shortly after, B Company touches down on the beach.
"
The Wrong Turtle to Mess With,73,"The cover of this chapter shows Bulma riding a motorcycle while Goku flies above her on his Flying Nimbus.
 Master Roshi attacks Captain Dark Master Roshi asks the Red Ribbon Army members surrounding his house who they are. Captain Dark, ignoring this question, asks if Master Roshi is the genius who invented the Dragon Radar. At Master Roshi's confusion, Dark tells him that pretending is useless, but Master Roshi, still confused, asks again who they are. The officer replies that they are the Red Ribbon Army, and Master Roshi acknowledges that he has heard of them. Another soldier then emerges from the house with ""good"" Launch and announces that no one but her is in the house. Master Roshi asks what the Army wants and Captain Dark demands the two Dragon Balls that Goku left, as well as the Dragon Radar. Master Roshi inquires what they plan to do with the Dragon Balls and the officer informs him that it is not any of his business.
 Master Roshi goes on a rampage against the Red Ribbon Army soldiers Roshi asks what they will do if he resists and Dark chuckles and says that they will kill him. Master Roshi then declares that he will fight, and proceeds to blithely beat up Dark and a great deal of other soldiers. One soldier shoots at Master Roshi, but Master Roshi catches the bullets, drops them, and defeats the soldier. Another soldier then holds a gun to Launch's head and shouts at Master Roshi to stop and hand over the Dragon Balls. Master Roshi accedes, but Turtle surreptitiously tickles Launch's nose with a plant to make her sneeze.
 Bad Launch appears and knocks out a Red Ribbon Army soldier She transforms into her blonde form and defeats the soldier, prompting Master Roshi to drag her away before she abuses him any further. Spotting another soldier trying to sneak away from the scene, Master Roshi instructs him to take all the unconscious Red Ribbon Army bodies away.
 Meanwhile, Goku, Bulma, and Krillin have been chased into a cave by General Blue's squad. The squad avoids firing torpedoes in fear of bringing the cave down and thus continues chasing. Goku and company surface at a part of the cave with air, abandoning the ship and escaping on foot. General Blue then receives a radio message from the other squad, and is shocked to discover it has been decimated. Goku suddenly comes to the decision that they should fight instead of run, ignoring Bulma and Krillin's protests that the Army has guns. General Blue, however, tells his men to halt, stating that the enemy is more fearsome than he expected. Goku is curious as to why the Army has not come after them yet, but Bulma stops him from investigating it on the grounds that it could be a trap, and the trio proceed through the cave. General Blue then announces that he will cleverly destroy Goku, Bulma, Krillin, Roshi, and Launch.
"
The Pirates' Trap,74,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku standing in a fighting pose. A Skeleton Pirate wielding a sword can be seen behind him.
 Goku scares Bulma with a skull on his head The cave is pretty dark now, and Goku wonders if they will really find the Dragon Ball. Bulma tells Krillin he should go first since his bald head is so bright, and then Goku finds a light switch. Bulma wonders how there’s electricity here, someone must be using it. Blue and his troops see this, too, and he thinks it might be some kind of secret base. Bulma wonders about this undersea cave, and then Goku scares her by wearing a skull on his head. Blue hears the enemy scream, and tells this a soldier to go investigate. Goku laughs and takes off the skull, and Bulma yells at him. Krillin asks where he got that thing, and Goku points to a pirate skeleton. Krillin thinks some old pirates had their treasure somewhere in here, and Bulma and Krillin get excited about it. The soldier radios Blue about that, and Blue is very delighted.
 Krillin avoids one of the booby trap through pure fortune The three of them come to a weird hallway with dots on the floor and holes in the walls, and Krillin thinks nothing of it and walks forward. He steps on one of the dots, and a spear shoots out just above Krillin's head. Bulma realizes it is a trap they used to protect their treasure from intruders, and the buttons on the floor set it off. Goku tells Krillin being a chibi saved him, and he tells Goku he is a chibi, too. Then, Goku gets an idea: they will jump over the floor to the other side. Goku jumps first, and makes it no problem. Krillin thinks he won’t have much problem either because of Muten Rōshi's training. He jumps, but goes too high, and his head hits the ceiling and he just barely makes it. Goku yells for Bulma to jump now, but she yells that she can not.
 Blue's soldiers fall victim to booby traps Blue and his men catch up to the soldier who was watching the enemy, and he says they’re still wandering around, and they don not have any weapons. Blue smirks about them carelessly leaving their weapons in their submarine, and then giggles about the assured victory. Bulma is hanging from the Nyoi-Bō now, while Goku slowly retracts it, so that she can get across. Afterwards, they move on, and wonder what is wrong with this next room. Blue yells for his troops to move on, and attack to kill, and quietly thinks about getting the Dragon Balls and the treasure after they go on ahead of him. Then Blue hears a bunch of screams, and runs ahead to see all of his men dead, stuck with spears in them, in the weird hallway. “Pardon me, we didn’t mean to get wiped out…” says one soldier who’s not quite dead yet. Blue thinks a minute, and since the brat got through, the pirates must have had a way to get through also… Blue finds a switch and the wall opens up. Elsewhere, Goku, Krillin, and Bulma find the pirates’ harbor.
"
Robot in Waiting!,75,"The cover of this chapter shows Bulma in the center holding a gun, with the Pirate Robot, Goku, Krillin and General Blue surrounding her.
 The harbor is huge, there is a dock with a huge ship, building, and cars. Bulma thinks it must have been the pirates’ base, and Krillin thinks the treasure is somewhere in here. They talk about the harbor some more, while Blue watches on, thinking about killing them and getting the Dragon Ball and the treasure. Goku senses something, and Blue gets scared, but Goku tells Krillin it is not the Red Ribbon Army, since it is not human. Then a Pirate Robot bursts out of the building, with a gun for a left arm and a sword in his right hand. It swipes at them with the sword, and they just barely dodge it. Bulma knew there would be ghosts here, but Krillin says it is a robot.
 The Pirate Robot appears They dodge the bullets as the robot starts to fire at them and Goku rushes at it, kicking it in the back of the head. Then Krillin chops the blade of the sword off with his hand, and the two of them prepare to attack its legs. Blue notes their use of kenpō, and then the robot slugs Krillin in the face and knocks him back a few feet. Krillin thinks it is strong, and they prepare to attack while Bulma watches on. The pirate robot fires at them some more, and as they hide behind some crates, Goku tells Krillin to go find the Dragon Ball with Bulma while he takes care of the robot. Goku jump kicks the robot into the water, and Krillin and Bulma take the opportunity to run away, and Blue follows them at a safe distance. Goku looks down into the water, and the robot’s tail pulls him down below and starts to electrocute him. Then Goku breaks off the tail and jumps to the surface, and decides to take Nyoi-Bō up to the roof of the building. The robot jumps out of the water and looks around. Goku dives straight down at it and punches straight through the robot, causing it to explode.
 Goku runs to try to catch up with the others. Meanwhile, Krillin notices that explosion is causing the foundation to crack. He and Bulma run like hell, and when they come to a fork in the path, Krillin marks the direction they take for Goku. When Blue catches up, he erases the arrow and draws a new one pointing in the opposite direction. Soon after, Goku notices the arrow and heads left instead of right.
"
The Treasure!,76,"The cover of this chapter shows Yamcha, Bulma, Puar, Krillin and Oolong driving in a Car, while Goku flies above them on the Flying Nimbus. Goku is also holding a steering wheel, even though that the Nimbus does not need one.
 Goku meets a giant ocotpus Goku heads left and General Blue laughs, continuing to follow the others right. Krillin and Bulma come to a dead end with nothing but a hole. There’s water, so Krillin strips down to his boxers and Bulma takes off her shorts, and they dive in. Blue catches up, and starts taking off his shirt and hat as he wonders if the water is clean. Goku comes to a dead end, too, and falls through a trap door, but he luckily lands on something soft which happens to be an octopus. Goku jumps off of his head onto a rock and says, believes Octopapa to be a squid. Octopapa becomes annoyed, and then Goku says he has to leave now. But then Octopapa grabs Goku with one of his tentacles, since it has been so long since he is had anything good. He smacks him up against the rocks a few times, trying to kill him. Goku asks if he wants something really good, which causes Octopapa to wonder about what it could be. In reality, Goku uses this opportunity to blast him right in the face with a Kamehameha.
 Goku fires a Kamehameha at the giant octopus Bulma and Krillin surface in a room, and they spot a treasure chest. They get out and open it, and it’s full of the treasure. They are both really excited, but then General Blue surfaces and informs them that the Red Ribbon Army will be taking that treasure. Bulma sees him, and thinks he’s just her type. She rubs up against him with her tongue hanging out as well as meowing like a cat, and he screams to get away, he does not like that. Krillin and Bulma think he must be homosexual. Blue yells at them to not say such things, since he might get mad, but Krillin is not worried.
 Krillin and Bulma find the treasure Goku likes this real takoyaki (fried octopus), as he was hungry. Then he hears a scream, and wonders if it was not Bulma or Krillin. Krillin is up against the wall, and he’s taken a lot of damage. Krillin gets up and tells General Blue he’s going to be serious this time, and they go at each other, but Krillin just takes a hard punch to the face. Bulma screams and Goku recognizes it this time, and hops in the water to swim toward them.
"
Bright Blue Eyes,77,"The cover of this chapter shows Krillin and General Blue facing off against each other, seemingly about to fight one another, while Bulma is hiding behind a treasure chest.
 General Blue paralyzes Krillin Krillin can not believe how strong Blue is, and he slowly gets back up. Blue can not believe Krillin still wants to fight, and Bulma cheers her friend on. Krillin runs at Blue and leaps up, leaving an afterimage on the ground. He comes down and kicks Blue in the face. Blue gets up, and can not believe he kicked his beautiful face. Blue notices his nose is bleeding, and really freaks out, due to a nosebleed being humiliating for a general, with Krillin wondering what Blue's problem was.
 Now wearing nose plugs, Blue is very disgusted with the situation, and he looks towards Krillin and is going to make this kid pay. Then, his eyes flash, and Krillin can not move anymore. Blue says it is his Telekinesis, and Bulma can not believe it. While Blue threatens to kill Krillin, Goku continues swimming to the rescue. Blue kicks the little guy up in the air, and then punches Krillin and sends him flying into the wall. Krillin slides down, Blue chuckles, and Bulma is worried about how she will be killed next.
 Krillin paralyzed by General Blue Blue notices the Pirate Cave is falling down, and thinks he will have to hurry up with them and find the Dragon Ball. Bulma decides she will have to use her sex appeal to save the day. She calls Blue out and starts flirting with him, giggling and wiggling her ass. Blue yells for her stop being so vulgar, and then she expresses shock that it didn't work, causing her to realize her earlier assumption of his being gay may actually be valid after all. Bulma says she is really a man, but Blue screams that if that were truly the case, that meant she's a freak of nature, and she runs away. Blue threatens to kill her, and then picks up a huge rock and prepares to send Krillin to the afterlife.
 General Blue attacks a paralyzed Krillin Just then, Goku jumps out of the water, and Blue stops what he is doing. Bulma yells for Goku to beat up this Red Ribbon guy who tried to kill them, and Goku says he is going to beat him up for doing this to Krillin. Goku and Blue face-off, and Blue swipes at Goku, but he ducks it and punches Blue in the gut. Once Blue regains his composure, he tries to sweep kick Goku, but Goku jumps over it. Goku kicks off the cave wall and knees Blue in the back of the head. Krillin remarks Goku has gotten stronger since the last World Martial Arts Tournament. Blue starts to get really pissed, and Bulma yells to look out for his eyes. Now Goku can not move, and Blue has got a huge rock again.
"
The Great Escape!,78,"The cover of this chapter shows several duplicates of Goku taking up the whole page.
 General Blue attacks a paralyzed Goku  Bulma and Krillin are worried, and Blue asks Goku how he likes his Chōnōryoku (psychic ability). Blue kicks him, and Goku bounces off the ceiling and hits the ground. Then the cave starts caving in some more, and Blue thinks he will have to hurry and get the treasure and Dragon Balls. Blue pulls a capsule from his pocket, and out pops a shotgun. He points the gun at Goku, and threatens to shoot the kid if the girl does not tell him where the Dragon Ball is. Bulma tells him it is probably in the bottom of the pool over there. Blue thanks her, and says he still has to kill anyone who messes with the Red Ribbon Army.
 Goku attacks General Blue with the Rock, Scissors 'N' Paper combo Bulma starts crying about her being next after Goku dies, and Krillin thinks she talks too much. The shotgun is in Goku’s face, and just after Blue yells “Farewell!!!”, a mouse runs along. Blue shrieks about the filthy mouse, and drops the gun and loses his concentration. Goku can move again, and Krillin and Bulma cheer him on. Blue is displeased at Goku’s escape, and Goku says he will be punished with his Janken Gū. Goku rushes at him, pokes him in the eyes with a Choki, and quickly uses his Janken Gū. Goku sends Blue flying into the wall, and he’s knocked out.
 There is no time for celebration, though, since the cave is crumbling apart even more. Goku asks Bulma about the Dragon Ball, and she points to the pool. Goku tells them to run away while he searches for the Dragon Ball, and they run off as he dives down. Goku swims his way to the bottom of the pool, while Bulma and Krillin are on the way back towards the harbor. Goku moves a rock aside, and he finds the Three-Star Ball. He puts it in his shirt and heads back towards the surface, and Bulma and Krillin are running like hell through the harbor as the ceiling continues to crumble.
 Goku finds the Dragon Ball Goku makes it to the surface, and then he looks for the mouse before he escapes. He finds him, and wants to return the favor, so he puts the mouse in his mouth and runs away. Bulma and Krillin come to the exit of the harbor, but it’s blocked off by fallen rocks, and so they decide to try the little submarine in the water there. Elsewhere, Blue wakes up, and tries to take the treasure chest with him, but the ceiling in the treasure room falls in on him. Bulma and Krillin have gotten the engine started, but they can’t leave without Goku, who’s still running back towards the harbor with the Three-Star Ball in his shirt and the mouse in his mouth.
"
"Run, Run, Run!!!",79,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku, Krilin and Bulma in a miniature submarine with worried looks on their face as large rock are falling around the miniature submarine.
 The harbor is in horrible shape, and Bulma thinks they should leave, but Krillin doesn’t want to leave Goku to die. Bulma yells out that her own life is the most important thing in the world to her, and Krillin faintly agrees. Bulma thinks Goku will be alright, and as they prepare to dive, Krillin notices Goku’s come. He runs through the harbor, and a rock falls on his head, but he keeps going, and they call him over to the submarine.
 Goku fires a Kamehameha to propel the submarine The submarine dives down, and fallen rocks are everywhere. Goku pulls the mouse out of his mouth, and he’s glad he’s alright. The water becomes even more cluttered with rocks, and Krillin yells out about the whole cave collapsing. They get excited about getting to the tunnel that leads back into the ocean, until the submarine runs out of gas.
Goku tells Krillin to hold onto this mouse, and then he faces the back of the sub. He does the Kamehameha, and the glass covering blows off, and the submarine is propelled from the collapsing cave tunnel to the surface of the ocean. They are all in mid-air, and Goku calls for Kinto-Un, then grabs Krillin’s foot, and Krillin grabs Bulma’s arm in one hand while still holding the mouse in the other. They happily fly off in their odd formation, and then Blue’s head pops up from the water.
 Bulma reveals she has a piece of the treasure They are all three relieved to be saved, as they sit on the shore where Blue’s base is. Krillin’s a bit disappointed that they did not get any of that treasure, but Bulma smirks and digs through her panties, and pulls out a huge diamond. Krillin is impressed, but wonders about how she kept it between her legs without it sticking out… Goku shows that he got the Dragon Ball, and Bulma asks if he’s going to keep on searching until he gets the Four-Star Ball. Bulma refuses to risk her life for him anymore, and Goku reminds her that she was the one who insisted on coming. And she says she wouldn’t have come if he’d mentioned the Red Ribbon Army was involved. Krillin points out a Red Ribbon plane on the island, and says they should just go back to Muten Rōshi's house.
 Blue makes it to the shore, and notices Goku on Kinto-Un and the others in the plane, and thinks they are returning to their secret base. Bulma tells Krillin that they will give this diamond to Kame-Sen’nin to make up for losing his submarine, and Krillin’s a bit disappointed. Then he starts sniffing the diamond, and Bulma starts yelling at him. As they head back, Blue is following them in a plane of his own.
"
The Three Stolen Dragon Balls,80,"The cover of this chapter shows General Blue on a motorcycle and wielding a pistol with Goku on his Flying Nimbus in the background.
 Back at Kame House, Master Roshi can not believe they are giving him the diamond, and Bulma tells him it is worth tens of billions of zeni. Master Roshi thinks to himself about how he could have stripper's every day, and Krillin wants him to not waste that, since they almost died getting it. Turtl thinks he should hold onto it so that Master Roshi doesn’t do anything bad, and Master Roshi yells at him.
 The Dragon Ball Gang are tied up by General Blue Then, Launch (bad) pulls out a gun and tells them not to move, and to quietly hand over the diamond. Master Roshi obliges, and then Launch blasts off in the Red Ribbon plane. Bulma does not understand what just happened, since she’d never met Launch before, and so Krillin and Master Roshi explain how she changes when she sneezes.
 Meanwhile, General Blue spots their secret base on the island with his binoculars. He grabs some rope and dives down onto the island from his plane, landing on his feet, and he hides behind the side of the house. Goku talks about how he’s going to go find the next Dragon Ball, and Bulma asks Master Roshi if he will lend her a plane to return home with. He doesn’t have one, and offers to let her live here as his mistress, and she yells at him. Goku wants him to hold onto these Dragon Balls, and Master Roshi explains to the worried Krillin about how he, the great Muten Rōshi, has no trouble taking out the Red Ribbon Army.
 Launch cuts Goku free and Goku throws the bomb into the sky Blue tosses the rope into the air, and uses his telekinesis tie everyone up. “Hohohoh! We meet again. How do you like this? It’s my Two Shot Chōnōryoku.” Bulma, Goku, and Krillin can not believe he survived, and Blue goes in the house to find the Dragon Balls. They all struggle to get out and Krillin asks the great Muten Rōshi to do something, but then Blue comes out with the bag full of all three balls. Blue leaves them a present as a thanks; a bomb that will explode in five minutes. Blue pulls out a capsule with another jet plane, and as he prepares to leave, Bulma asks if she can join him, but Blue says they do not have women in the Red Ribbon Army. Master Roshi then volunteers, but Blue just takes off, telling them to enjoy their last four minutes.
 They all keep struggling to get untied and get rid of the bomb, but can not, and then Launch (good) returns. Everyone yells for her to get rid of the bomb. She thinks she should throw it in the trash, so Goku yells for her to untie him. There’s only five seconds left, and he manages to toss it really high into the air at the last second. Then he calls for Kinto-Un, and flies off after Blue, and catches up to him over another land.
"
Chased to Penguin Village!,81,"The cover of this chapter shows General Blue in his Thunder Rocket with Goku on his Flying Nimbus in the background, trying to catch up to him.
 General Blue's plane crashes into a mountain On a mysterious island, a bunch of Dr. Slump characters are walking home from school. Norimaki Senbe appears behind them and starts giving the “V” sign. Akane wants to know what he’s doing, and he explains that he hasn’t been in “Jump” for a long time, so he’s showing everyone how happy he is to see them. A couple other characters make a cameo appearance, and then Arale, accompanied by Gacthan, shows up and says hello. Then Arale and Gacthan run home, when they notice Kinto-Un and Blue’s jet whooshing through the air. Goku’s just behind Blue, and Blue decides he needs to get rid of him. Goku tells Kinto-Un to speed up, and he gets ahead of Blue. Goku sticks his tongue out, and Blue can’t believe it. Goku pulls out the Nyoi-Bō, and prepares to whack Blue’s ship, but Blue makes a U-turn. Goku easily catches up, since Blue’s cut off his engines, and they’re over Arale’s house. Blue laughs about Goku being right behind him now, and fires off the Rocket Engines, blasting Goku in the face and knocking him off Kinto-Un. Blue laughs about this, but then crashes into a mountain as Goku falls to the ground. Goku laughs about Blue being stupid, and he lands feet first in front of Arale. She greets him, “N’cha!”, and Goku responds with “Ossu!” Goku calls for Kinto-Un, and zooms off, and Arale and Gacthan run after him. Elsewhere, we find that Blue’s still alive…
"
The Broken Dragon Radar,82,"The cover features Goku, both Gatchans and Arale Norimaki surfing on the Flying Nimbus.
 Blue stumbles along through the random mountain things, holding the bag with the Dragon Balls. He’s pissed about the brat, and then spots him coming this way to take back his Dragon Balls. Goku doesn’t see Blue, though, and hopes the Dragon Balls didn’t get broken with the plane. Blue wonders about getting back to Red Ribbon Headquarters while hiding, and then jumps down into a valley, landing feet first.
 Goku rummages through the wreckage, but he can’t find the Dragon Balls, or Blue’s body, which must mean he’s still alive. Then Arale arrives, and Goku’s impressed that she’s as fast as Kinto-Un. He wants to know where she trained, but she doesn’t understand. She asks why he’s here, and he says he’s looking for a bad guy. Then Goku calls Kinto-Un back over, and hops on to get a better look at the place.
 Blue’s at a phone booth, and he wonders how he’ll return to headquarters, when he spots a car. He waves down the car, and the guy inside gets pissed. Blue wants the car, and the driver realizes it’s a robbery. How convenient that they’re so close to the phone booth… He runs inside, and then comes out, and shows his true form that appears from eating umeboshi (dried ume fruit); “Suppaman!!!” Blue’s not impressed, though, and so now Suppaman’s going to show him his power. Blue still doesn’t care, and smashes the phone booth. Now Suppaman wants to know what he can do for him, and Blue wants capsules or a plane. Suppaman doesn’t know what capsules are, and Blue thinks he must be a bumpkin, and wants to know about a plane. Suppaman thinks a minute, and then says Norimaki Senbe has one. “You go way down this road, and when you see the sea, his house is to the right.” Blue takes off with Suppaman’s car.
 Goku still can’t find Blue, and then remembers to check the Dragon Radar. Except that it’s broken again, and he thinks he’ll have to go back to Bulma. Then he asks Arale where this is, and she tells him this is Penguin Village. Goku says he came here after someone, and asks if she knows where Kame-Sen’nin’s place is, but she doesn’t. Goku’s worried about this, not knowing where he is. Arale asks if his thing is broken, and Goku says it is. Arale tells him that the doctor can fix that no problem!
 Goku asks if she knows where his house is, and she does. Then Arale wants to know if she can get on the cloud, and she does no problem, and they zoom off towards the house. Arale liked the ride, and Senbe and his wife wonder who this kid is. Arale points to Senbe, saying he’s the doctor, and then Goku says, “Ossu… No… Good afternoon!” Goku shows him the Dragon Radar, and explains that it tells you where Dragon Balls are, but Senbe doesn’t know what that is, of course. The little baby, Turbo, understands how the radar catches the unique waves, though. Senbe gets to work on it, and it’s really complicated, and he wants to know who created it. “A woman named Bulma.” Senbe can’t believe a woman is a greater genius than him. Elsewhere, Blue’s driving and is almost to the house with the plane.
"
The Stolen Dragon Radar,83,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku and Arale Norimaki wearing each other's signature clothes, while Arale is on the Flying Nimbus.
 Senbe continues working on the radar, worrying about his genius position, and with a little magical help from Turbo, it’s finished. Meanwhile, Blue makes his way to the house, and spots the plane. But the brat is there too. Senbe returns the fixed Dragon Radar to Goku, and he’s very happy, but thinks it odd that it says the three Dragon Balls are right here. Then Blue runs in and grabs Arale and puts a knife to her head. Everyone’s confused, but Goku’s pissed, and wants his Dragon Balls back.
 Blue’s eyes flash, and Goku can’t move again. Turbo recognizes the Chōnōryoku, and the wife asks Goku if this is a friend, but he says he’s a bad guy. Then Blue notices the radar, and snatches it from Goku’s hand. He’s going to take this plane, too. Blue hasn’t forgotten about Goku, though, and he tosses the bag with the Dragon Balls in the plane, and says he’s going to kill him. First he whacks Goku in the back of the head really hard, and then chops down a palm tree with his hand. He stands over Goku with it, and says he’ll make a shish kebab with him.
 General Blue takes Senbei's airplane Senbe yells for Arale to get this dude with her Pro Wrestling moves, and she runs in and gets him in the back with an “Arale Kick” and sends him flying with a headbutt to the gut. She runs after Blue, or rather, ahead of him, and then jumps up and headbutts him off into the distance. Goku can move again, and then Arale comes back. She tells Goku she beat him up, and he’s very impressed. Arale tells him that Gacthan is also strong, and so is her friend Obocchaman. Goku thinks he’ll have to train more and more with all these strong people in the world.
 Then Goku finds the bag with the Dragon Balls in the plane, but the Dragon Radar was in Blue’s pocket. Goku’s very disappointed, thinking that Bulma will have to make another one, but then Turbo says he’ll make one. He asks Father if he can use some parts from the plane, and Senbe wonders if Turbo can make another one. Turbo says he remembers how from watching, and then magically takes the parts from the plane and makes a new one instantly. “Awesome!! Thanks!!!” Senbe is not surprised his kid would be a genius. Goku calls for Kinto-Un, and thanks everyone. He tells Arale she should participate in the next Tenka’ichi Budōkai.
 Goku leaves and they all wave goodbye, and Senbe wonders about that kid. Blue, meanwhile, is in a phone booth, and he tells the person on the other end he managed to get the enemy’s radar. The person tells him to hurry back to headquarters, but Blue says it’s not that simple. He’s out in a desert, with pyramids and telephone poles…
"
The Karin Sanctuary,84,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku in the air with his Power Pole in hand and small aircraft in the background.
 Goku flies along on Kinto-Un, and wonders if the next Dragon Ball being Grandpa’s Four-Star Ball. Meanwhile, back at Red Ribbon Headquarters, Black tells Red that the brat is headed west, and Red says that is towards Captain Yellow's location. Red asks if they’re still having trouble finding the Dragon Ball there, and Black says they are. Red’s not too thrilled with that.
 Commander Red and Staff Officer Black In a wooded are called the Karin Holy Land, a very large Native American man is standing in front of a tower holding a spear, and this tiger and his men want him to quietly hand over the Dragon Ball. The man says he protects this holy land, and he’ll make them pay if they do something to disrupt this place. The tiger just laughs about this, and the man says they either leave or die. A little boy, also a Native American, tells his father to look behind him and the man throws his spear, and it impales a guy through a tree. The tiger tells his men to attack, but the bullets don’t affect the man. The man punches one of them in the face, and then throws another into a tree. He then kicks a guy while punching another and the tiger decides to retreat.
 Captain Yellow threatens Bora The man sees the tiger taking off in his plane, and drops the last guy on the ground. The little boy runs over to his father, and the man says to wait here while he buries these people. The tiger radios into headquarters and reports in as Captain Yellow. He tells Black that all of his men were wiped out, and Black tells him if he fails, he’s history. Then Red walks in, and tells Yellow that this is his last chance, and if he can’t get it, he’s calling Tao Pai-pai. Yellows scared now, and Black wonders about the hitman Tao Pai-pai. Yellow says he can take the man's child as a hostage to get the ball. The little boy is roasting a fish on a small fire, thinking about being strong like his father, when Yellow swoops down in his plane and grabs him.
 Bora stands up to the Red Ribbon Amy soldiers The man hears his son screaming. Yellow says if he does not hand over the Dragon Ball, he will kill this kid. Black thinks this is good back at headquarters, but Red is more worried about the brat named Son Goku. Then a bear tells Red that Son Goku is rapidly approaching Yellow’s location. The man tells Yellow to come down here to get the ball, but Yellow wants him to throw it up there, and the man says he’s not a coward like them.
 Then, Goku shows up on Kinto-Un, and sees the plane, and the little boy crying. Goku flies over to the plane, and sees that this is a Red Ribbon plane, and hops on. He punches Yellow right out of the plane, and Upa starts falling. The man is worried, but Goku swoops down and catches him on Kinto-Un. “Ossu!” Black says the radio’s cut off, and Red tells him to call Tao Pai-pai.

Taopaipai the Assassin,85,"The cover shows four rectangles each containing a character. The top rectangle shows Goku, then Mercenary Tao, then Bora, and at the bottom Commander Red.
 Mercenary Tao kills General Blue with his tongue In the Sacred Land of Korin, after saving Bora's son Upa from Captain Yellow, Goku is given a gift for his kind deed. It turns out to be the Four-Star Dragon Ball, which Goku had been searching for his entire journey. Meanwhile, a frustrated General Blue arrives at the Red Ribbon Army Headquarters. The two soldiers who guard the HQ do not recognize Blue, and thus threaten him to leave. In response, Blue easily kills one of the guards by elbowing him into a wall, proving he really is General Blue, much to the other guard's fear, who lets him right into the HQ. In the HQ, Commander Red is talking to the infamous Tao who explains to Red that his fee for an assassination is not cheap. Officer Black, Commander Red's assistant has doubts about Tao's abilities, to which Tao replies if he would like to prove his reputation to be true. Suddenly, General Blue arrives in Red's room, handing him over the Dragon Radar he managed to snatch from Penguin Village. Red congratulates Blue on handing him the radar, but still considers Blue a failure for not retrieving the Dragon Balls themselves. Red, however, offers Blue a deal. If he can defeat Mercenary Tao, he will not be executed for failure. Tao and Blue prepare to have their match, when Tao claims he will defeat Blue only using his tongue. Blue laughs at the idea, as the fight begins. Blue tries to kick Tao, but Tao easily dodges his attacks. Tao keeps to his word, as he kills Blue with his tongue, striking a pressure point on his head, completely shocking Red and Black. After killing Blue, Officer Black gives Tao a photo of Goku, telling him that Goku is his target. Instead of taking a jet, Tao takes one of the Red Ribbon Army Headquarter pillars, and throws it into the sky, riding it to his next destination, to finish Goku.
 In the anime, Blue uses his telekinesis to try and halt Tao's movement so he can strike a blow. In the manga version, Tao instantly kills Blue with his tongue, not giving Blue time to use his telekinesis.
"
The Devastating Dodon-pa!!!,86,"Bora is stabbed by his spear and killed by Tao As Mercenary Tao continues to fly through the air on his pillar towards the Sacred Land of Korin, Bora explains to Goku what Korin Tower is, as Goku is quite curious. Bora tells Goku that in myth, that if you climb the whole tower, you will become much stronger. Just as Bora finishes his story, Upa spots something heading towards them in the sky. It is Tao himself, arriving at his destination, almost crashing into Bora, Goku and Upa themselves. When Bora demands to know why Tao is here, Tao explains he is an assassin, and that he has come for the boy named Goku, saying the Red Ribbon Army sent him, much to Goku's anger.
 Goku fires a Kamehameha at Tao When Tao prepares to start his attack on Goku, Bora swears to protect Goku no matter what, as he had saved Upa's life earlier. When Bora prepares to attack Tao with his spear, Tao grabs the spear with two fingers with lightning speed, which even Goku could not see clearly. As Bora is rendered completely helpless, Tao mocks Bora, now holding the spear with only one finger. Tao then starts to become bored of messing with Bora, and throws him high in the air. While Bora continues to soar upwards, Tao in a cold manner asks if Bora wants his spear back, and throws the spear at Bora, stabbing him directly through the heart. As Bora's corpse falls to the ground, Upa and Goku look on in shock, as Bora's body finally plummets onto the ground.
 Goku hit by Tao's Dodon Ray As Upa runs towards his father in a huge state of shock and sadness, Goku looks onto Tao with an angry mind. As Tao smirks while Goku charges wildly towards him, Tao easily dodges Goku's rush, kicking him towards Korin Tower. As Tao believes Goku to be dead, he makes his way to find the Dragon Balls Commander Red wanted. Goku, however, had survived Tao's assault, and charges a Kamehameha, much to Tao's surprise. Goku fires the Kamehameha blast at full power, to which Tao blocks the energy wave. After the dust from the blast disappears, Goku stares on in shock that Tao had not only survived the blast, but was not damaged in the slightest, with the only effect from the blast being Tao's ruined suit. In anger over his suit being ruined, Tao points his finger towards Goku, in with a giant yell screams ""Dodon-pa!"" as he fires his deadly attack from his fingertip, hitting Goku directly on his chest. As Upa watches in horror as Goku seems to have been killed by the blast, Tao takes Goku's bag containing his Dragon Balls, and calls the mission a success.
"
The Great Climb,87,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku and Bora lying on the ground. Upa and the start of the Korin Tower can be seen behind them.
 Tao Pai-pai pulls the pillar from the ground and prepares to leave, and then Upa picks up a rock and throws it at him for killing Father and Big Brother. But Tao Pai-pai just blows it back and it hits Upa in the face, and he tells the crying kid to be glad he is not dead. Then he tosses the pillar, and flies off, leaving Upa alone at the base of Karin Tower.
 Goku begins climbing up Korin Tower At the Red Ribbon Headquarters, Red is impressed with Tao Pai-pai's work. But then he and Black notice that the radar is showing Tao Pai-pai leaving the Karin Holy Land with only three Dragon Balls, and the fourth is still there, and Red is none too thrilled. Meanwhile, Tao Pai-pai is in a small town, and he shows a tailor a cute drawing of his old outfit, and wants him to make one with the same design. The tailor says it will take a week, and Tao Pai-pai “convinces” him to make it in three days. Then Tao Pai-pai uses the phone to call Red Ribbon Headquarters, and tells Red he will be back there in three days. He took care of the brat, and wants his money. But Red chews him out for only getting three Dragon Balls, and then he looks in the bag and notices. Red thinks it should not be much trouble going back and getting it if the brat is dead.
 Upa has buried his father, and then he takes the shovel and starts to bury Goku, but then… Goku wakes up. He has a hole in his shirt right where the kame logo was, and the Four-Star Ball falls out from it. Apparently that is where the Dodonpa hit, and Goku says Grandpa helped him. Then, Goku sees Bora's grave, and takes a serious look at his Dragon Ball. He tells Upa that he will gather all the Dragon Balls to return his father back to life. Upa tells Goku that that guy has his bag with the rest of the Dragon Balls.
 Goku makes it to the top of Korin Tower Goku says that Tao Pai-pai will have to come back for the Four-Star Ball, but gets pissed that his technique was useless against him. Upa tells Goku that he can surely climb Karin Tower, and Goku remembers about how strong you can get at the top. Goku stares up at it, and thinks about how it is too easy with Kinto-Un, and he has to use his own power. Goku decides to go for it, and Upa wishes him well. He puts the Four-Star Ball in a pouch at his side, and tells Upa to hide if things get dangerous.
 Goku jumps up really high to get things started, and quickly makes his way up, and eventually Upa says he can not see him anymore. Goku keeps going, and still can not see the top even after passing through the clouds. He almost falls down, but his tail saves him. Eventually, night passes, and he is still not there. He is hungry, so he is going really slow now. The next morning comes and he is slowly climbing, when he spots something. A little more climbing, and he reaches the top.
"
Sage of the Karin Tower,88,"The cover of this chapter shows Korin holding his staff with the pot containing the Sacred Water on it.
 Korin appears Goku makes his way to the top of the tower, and there is a huge platform supporting a palace at the top. He makes his way up from the tower through a hole in the floor, and wonders where the power-up is amongst all this weird stuff. As he looks through some weird water barrels, a voice calls him to come up. Goku leaves the room and heads upstairs to a big round room with no walls, just railing and a ceiling supported by pillars. There is an old cat standing there with a staff, who says he is impressed with the speed this chibi got up here, and Goku tells him he is even more of a chibi. Goku wants to know where the sen’nin is, and cat says it is him, but he is more of a cat hermit.
 Korin stops Goku from getting the Sacred Water Goku asks about the strange water that powers you up, because he wants to drink it. “Ah, the Super Holy Water.” The cat points to it, in a jar atop the stand in the middle of the room. He wants to know why Goku wants it, and Goku starts to explain, but the cat tells him to hush, then stares at him a minute. “Indeed. You are gathering the Dragon Balls to return Upa's father back to life. But you can not do that unless you become stronger than that Tao Pai-pai person…” Goku freaks out, and wants to know how he knew that without him talking, and the cat says he can read minds, since he is a sen’nin. The cat says his intentions are not impure.
 Goku walks over to the stand, and climbs up and prepares to take the jar with the strange water, but the cat wonders if he can drink it. Goku asks if he means it is yucky, and the cat says it is because he is going to interfere. He runs over and knocks Goku off the stand, and Goku is pissed, and thinks the cat is a bad guy. Goku jumps up for the jar again, but the cat jump kicks him back to the ground. Goku is pissed about this, and the cat explains that he needs to avoid his interference.
 Korin gives Goku a Senzu Bean Goku does the old point and look trick, and then jumps up for it while the cat's head is turned, but the cat just bonks him in the face with his staff. Then the cat puts the jar on the end of his staff, and starts waving it around, and Goku starts chasing him all over the place until he gets tired out. Goku says he needs to eat, and the cat decides to feed him. He tosses Goku a bean, and says it is a senzu, and one seed is worth ten days of food. Goku decides to eat it, and he is all filled up. He says he can get the jar now, and rushes at the cat, but still can not get it.
 Goku is exhausted now, and asks if he is the first to come up here. The cat says just one other person did, three hundred years ago, but Goku interrupts and asks him how old he is; eight hundred years. Goku says that it is way older than he is. The cat continues and tells Goku that this person was his teacher, but Goku does not know who he is talking about, and the cat says he means Muten Rōshi. Goku is amazed that Kame-Sen’nin got strong from drinking the strange water, and asks the cat if he happens to be a really famous person. The cat says to call him Karin-sama, and Goku asks how long it took Kame-Sen’nin to get the water. He holds up three fingers and Goku is amazed that it was three minutes. “No. Three years.”

A Drink of Water,89,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku standing in the center with Korin standing in the background.
 Goku uses the Afterimage Strike on Korin Goku can not believe it took Kame-Sen’nin three years, and Karin wonders how long it will take him. Goku says he can not wait that long, and decides to get serious. He hops around leaving some afterimages, and Karin recognizes Zanzōken. Karin jump kicks up into the air, missing a Goku, and Goku dives at mid-air Karin from above, but that was just an afterimage, and Goku dives into the ground. Karin knows how to counter Zanzōken. Goku can not believe he is already out of breath, and Karin explains that the air is thinner up here. Karin also says he probably has not noticed how much stronger he has gotten just climbing up Karin Tower.
 Goku claims the Sacred Water, much to Korin's surprise Then Karin holds up Goku's pouch, and Goku tells him to give it back. Instead, though, he throws it over the edge, so Goku runs down the tower to get it back, since it would be awful if the Red Ribbon Army got it. He grabs it, and scurries all the way back up the tower and yells at Karin for that. Karin laughs, and explains that it took Goku one day to get up here the first time, but this time, a round trip took him only three hours. Then they start the chase all over again, until night falls. They both go to sleep and Goku wakes up. He goes over to take the water, but then decides against it. Karin thinks to himself that he is honest, unlike Muten Rōshi.
 The chase continues the next day. Goku is determined to get it today, and so he rushes at Karin, and keeps swinging at him. Goku starts tickling Karin in mid-air when they are near the railing, and he accidentally drops his staff and the jar over the edge. Goku leaps off to grab it, and catches onto the railing with his tail. Goku asks if it is alright to drink it now, and Karin gives him the okay. He gulps it down, but he thinks that nothing has happened. Karin says the Super Holy Water is really just ordinary water, and Goku thinks he has been tricked. Karin says it was not a trick; he has already gotten stronger from climbing up and down Karin Tower and chasing him around. “Now then, test out the fruits of your training by returning to the lower world!” Goku is very happy, and he thanks him. As he leaves, Karin thinks how Goku has now surpassed Muten Rōshi.

 At the foot of the tower, Upa is running around with a little tomahawk and looks up, wondering if Goku made it to the top since it has been three days. Meanwhile, Tao Pai-pai’s outfit is finished, and he prepares to leave for the Dragon Ball, when the guy asks him to pay. Tao Pai-pai can’t believe he’d ask the world’s famous number one hitman, Tao Pai-pai, to give him money. The tailor says he needs money to live, but Tao Pai-pai decides on an alternate payment. He jabs him in the forehead with his finger, killing him.
 Goku launches a counterattack on Mercenary Tao Upa is still looking at the tower, when Tao Pai-pai's pillar crashes into the ground again. Tao Pai-pai tells him to give up the one remaining Dragon Ball, and Upa throws the tomahawk at him. Tao Pai-pai just ducks his head to the left, and then sweep kicks Upa. Tao Pai-pai then holds him up in the air by the neck, and asks about the ball, but Upa won’t say. So he thinks this stubborn brat wants to die, and throws him towards the tower. Goku is diving straight towards the ground, calls for Kinto-Un, and manages to catch Upa before he crashes into the tower.
 Upa’s very happy to see Goku and Tao Pai-pai is in shock. Goku tells Upa that he got stronger, and tells him to stay on the cloud. Tao Pai-pai asks how he survived his Dodonpa, and Goku says he was saved by his Dragon Ball. Tao Pai-pai says he got lucky, but a miracle will not happen a second time. He tells him to quietly hand over the Dragon Ball. Goku refuses, and Tao Pai-pai tells him it’ll be only three seconds this time. Tao Pai-pai comes at him, but Goku leans backwards and Tao Pai-pai punches right over him, and Goku knocks him straight into the air. Goku stands up again, then jumps straight up, and kicks Tao Pai-pai mid-air into the tower. Goku says that three seconds are already up, and Tao Pai-pai can not believe how he has changed in three days. Goku says he trained at the top of the tower, and Tao Pai-pai wonders about the sen’nin that lives up there. Tao Pai-pai thinks it’ll be interesting to see what’s come of the little exercise the kid’s had.

Tao Pai-pai comes at him again, but Goku jumps up, so Tao Pai-pai jumps in the air, too, and punches Goku towards the tower. Goku kicks off of it, and hits Tao Pai-pai with a punch of his own. Goku kicks off the ground, then kicks Tao Pai-pai headfirst into the ground. Tao Pai-pai comes back up, his clothes a bit tattered, and pulls off his shirt. He says he was going easy on him, and fires off a Dodonpa, but Goku stands to catch it this time. Goku gets pushed back a few yards, and other than his hands being a little sore, he is fine this time. Tao Pai-pai is in shock, and Goku says that his Kamehameha was ineffective last time, but now it’s Tao Pai-pai’s attack that does not work.
 Goku breaks Tao's sword in half with his Power Pole Upa’s happy with the situation, and Tao Pai-pai pulls a capsule from his pants. Out pops a sword and he starts swiping at Goku with it, who is just barely able to back out of the way. Tao Pai-pai slices through a tree that Goku’s hanging onto, and thinks it was great to use his sword. Upa hops off the cloud and runs into his teepee and throws Goku his Nyoi-Bō to even the score. Goku catches it mid-air, while avoiding Tao Pai-pai’s swipes, and lands on the ground. Tao Pai-pai comes at him, but one whack from the Nyoi-Bō is enough to cut the sword in half. Goku throws Nyoi-Bō aside and says he’ll defeat him with his bare hands.

 Tao's grenade is thrown back and explodes in his own face “You're going to defeat me, the world's number one hitman, Tao Pai-pai, with your bare hands…!!” Goku says that is right, and Tao Pai-pai keeps talking crap, but Goku tells him to just come on. Tao Pai-pai comes at him again and punches Goku in the face, then kicks Goku backwards. He delivers a hard shot to the gut, and starts pummeling Goku. Tao Pai-pai holds Goku up by the neck as Upa wonders what is wrong with him, and he kicks Goku up into the air.

 Tao Pai-pai laughs about his victory, but then Goku stands up smiling, and compliments his work. Tao Pai-pai thinks he is a freak, and Goku says it is time for his counterattack. Goku rushes at him, and delivers a slobber knocking blow to the gut, then chops at each side of Tao Pai-pai's neck with his hands, and kicks Tao Pai-pai in the face, knocking a tooth out. Tao Pai-pai wonders what to do about this, and gets an idea. Tao Pai-pai drops to his knees and begs for forgiveness, and says he will not do bad things anymore. Goku does not know what to do, and looks to Upa, then Tao Pai-pai makes his move. He throws a grenade at Goku, then jumps straight up to avoid it, but Goku just kicks it back up at Tao Pai-pai, and it explodes.

 Goku looks at the Dragon Radar, and wonders why the next two Dragon Balls are together. He realizes that place must be the Red Ribbon Army’s house, and decides he’ll go there and beat up everyone. Upa tells him he’s crazy, but Goku says he has to go there to get the Dragon Balls. Upa wants him to run away if things get dangerous and Goku calls for Kinto-Un. At Red Ribbon Headquarters, Colonel Violet has returned with the Five-Star Ball she found using the enemy’s Radar, and says it was really easy. Red tells Black to give that Radar to General Copper so he can find the next one. A guy notices that the four Dragon Balls have started moving, and Red thinks it must be Tao Pai-pai.
 Colonel Violet brings a Dragon Ball Goku continues along on Kinto-Un, when a little robot plane flies up to him. At Kame House, Bulma has set up some radar satellite equipment, and tells Kame-Sen’nin and Lunch that Son-kun’s on the TV. They come and look, and Bulma switches the TV to a radar/map screen, and says Goku’s headed in the direction of two other Dragon Balls. Lunch wonders if he isn’t headed towards Red Ribbon’s headquarters, so Bulma decides to send the little robot plane to go find out, leaving Goku behind.
 The little robot plane is now above Red Ribbon Headquarters, and Bulma switches the image to show the base. Then a plane destroys the little robot plane, and some guy in the control room wonders if it wasn’t Tao Pai-pai, but they say it was just a spy plane. Black says that the four Dragon Balls are here, and Red’s glad that Tao Pai-pai’s arrived. Goku spots their base, and pulls out the Nyoi-Bō, saying he’s going to get rowdy. The guy in the plane spots Tao Pai-pai, but as he gets closer he realizes it’s not him.
 Back at Kame House, Bulma says Son-kun is going to be killed, and Kame-Sen’nin decides they should go help him out. Umigame points out that they have no transportation. Bulma decides she’ll call Yamcha, but Umigame says they have no phone. She gets pissed, until Umigame tells her she could probably build one, and so she does. Dr. Brief picks up, wanting to tell her a joke, and she yells at him to put Yamcha on the line. She explains the situation, and apparently Yamcha knows of the Red Ribbon Army, as does Oolong. Yamcha yells at Pu’er and Oolong, telling them that they’re going to go help Goku, noting that he’s been getting bored here. Goku blows up the plane, and then one of the guys in the control room turns on the Laser Monitor and sees him. A bear guy yells to Red that it’s not Tao Pai-pai who has the four balls, but Son Goku.

Some guys spot him and start firing at him, but he continues hopping until he gets to a tower. Three little air tanks show up and start firing at him, and Goku hops onto the closest one and knocks the pilot out. He then jumps off and lets it crash into a roof, then fires off a Kamehameha at the next one, making it explode, and causing the third one to crash into a tower.

Goku keeps running along, all the ground soldiers are out, and the radar says the Dragon Balls are in Building Eight. A sniper starts firing at him, and Goku just gets pissed. The bear guy says he’s entered Building Eight, and Red and Black hurry that way.
 Yamcha arrives at Kame House in a plane and tells everyone to get in. Inside, Bulma and Oolong complain, they don’t see why they have to go, and Yamcha says they can all do something useful, Goku’s always helped them. Umigame asks “Even me?”, and Yamcha says nothing, and asks about Kuririn. Kame-Sen’nin says he went off swimming to go shopping, and Yamcha says he was fairly strong, they could use him.
 Red and Black have made it to the room with the Dragon Balls, and Red refuses to give them up. Yamcha and the others pick up Kuririn and tell him about helping Goku. He sees Lunch (bad) all hyped up about kicking some ass and asks her not to sneeze. Pu’er tells Yamcha it’ll be another forty minutes before they arrive. Meanwhile, Goku elbows another soldier in the face and sees that he still needs to go higher. He runs in from the balcony into this room, but there are no stairs. So, he jumps through the ceiling, and Red’s really pissed as he watches Goku beat up all the soldiers on the monitor.

Black says all their remaining soldiers are running away, and Red can not believe this is all happening just because of one brat.
 Staff Officer Black performing a coup d'état Red can not stand it, all he really wanted to make himself taller. Black can not believe they were gathering the Dragon Balls just for his height, when they could rule the world, but Red says being short makes him unpopular with the gals. He talks about how he was teased when he was in school, and Black says the Red Ribbon Army should be conquering the world. Red tells him to shut up, since he is the commander. Black can not take it anymore, and he shoots Red in the head. Black says he is in charge now, and then Goku shows up.
 Black offers Goku the opportunity to share the Dragon Balls and take over the world, and Goku says no, he is going to return Upa's father to life.

During the flight they all ponder Goku's newfound strength, and Muten Roshi believes that Goku will only get stronger and stronger.
 Back at the Kame House, Bulma has opened up the Dragon Radar and discovers that not one part of it has been broken. Goku points out that it showed all seven Dragon Balls before, and Bulma concludes that something might have swallowed it. She explains that if its electromagnetic waves are surrounded by a living being, the radar will not pick it up. Goku is about to give up, when Muten Roshi tells them they can go to see Fortuneteller Baba, as she will surely be able to locate it.

They watch a rich-seeming couple leave, and their spirits are fortified at seeing that not all of the visitors are big and strong. They wonder why the other strong visitors seem so pumped. They hear strange noises and see the guys from before return, injured. Stunned, they all follow the Ghost Usher in, where they meet Fortuneteller Baba. Goku muses that her name is weird, and she snaps at him that it's only a nickname. Goku tells her there's something they want her to find, and she asks for ten million Zeni. Yamcha tells her they do not have enough money, and Baba says she figured as much and leads them to an outdoor ring.
 Baba then tells the apprehensive team that if they want her to tell them where the object they are looking for is, they will have to fight one at a time with each of her fighters. If they win, they will move onto the next fighter, but if someone in Goku's party loses, they must let another in the group take their place. Goku's group is hopeful once more, and Krillin points out that three of them made it far in the last World Martial Arts Tournament. Baba seems excited by this, and Goku's group is confident that they will make it.
"
The Five Champions,99,"The cover of this chapter shows Puar, Krillin, Goku, Yamcha and Upa standing in a group.
 Baba tells them they should stop, they are only kids, but Kuririn and Yamcha are not worried. Puar and Upa say they are not fighters, though, and Baba wonders about only three of them going up against her extremely strong five. Kuririn’s still really confident, and Yamcha asks about the rules. “Basically, if you give up or fall into the lake, it’s a loss.”
 Fangs the Vampire bites Krillins head Baba calls for the match to start, and Kuririn is going first. He tells Goku he will probably beat up all five himself, and then Baba calls out Dracula Man. A bat flies out, and then turns into a freaky vampire dressed like a kick boxer. Kuririn thinks he looks frail, and Baba calls for the match to begin. Kuririn flies at him with a kick, but Dracula Man just jumps up and turns into a bat again. He starts flying all over the place, and Kuririn can not keep up with his speed. Then, he jumps on Kuririn's back, as a person again, and bites down on his head.
 Goku tells Kuririn to shake him off, and Baba laughs and says he needs to hurry and give up before he bleeds to death. Kuririn then leaps backward, like a back flip, with Dracula Man still on his head, and Dracula Man let's go of him and Kuririn lands headfirst. Baba offers him a blood transfusion after he loses (the ghost has a bag of blood), but Kuririn still wants to go, and starts to get pissed, but blood starts squirting out from the holes in his head. Yamcha yells for Kuririn to calm down, so he starts praying, but the blood just leaks out instead of shooting up. Everyone laughs at him, and he starts to get really pissed, and loses so much blood he starts to get lightheaded. Dracula Man takes the opportunity to kick him into the lake.
 Fangs the Vampire is defeated The ghost gives him the blood transfusion, and then Kuririn's head is all taped up. Goku tells him he lost too easily, and Kuririn yells at him, then Baba asks who will fight Dracula Man next. They all discuss it, and then Puar and Upa step up. Goku asks if they can not fight together since they are so small, and Dracula Man goes for it (he can have blood from both of them). Yamcha tells them the plan again, and Upa chews on something. Then they get in the ring, and Dracula Man runs their way, and Upa breathes garlic in his face. Dracula Man really hates that, and so he turns into a bat, and then flies down towards Puar. Puar quickly transforms into a porcupine, but Dracula Man has him in his mouth. Dracula Man spits him out and looks up; Upa is standing in the form of a cross. Dracula Man turns into a bat again and tries to fly away, so Puar transforms into a hand and swats him down into the lake.
"
Battle of the Bleeders,100,"The cover of this chapter shows Yamcha in the center in a fighting pose. Puar, Krillin, Upa and Goku can be seen around him. A small chart is located at the bottom of the cover.
 Yamcha tells Puar and Upa to stay back so he can fight, and Baba notes that they only have two fighters left now, while she has four. But Yamcha says he will defeat the remaining four by himself. Goku is worried about not getting to fight, and Yamcha tells him it has been much longer since he has gotten the chance to fight.
 Krillin shows Bulma's breasts to Roshi Yamcha tells her to bring out the next fighter, and Baba says he is already here. Yamcha does not see him, and Baba says he is the invisible man, Mr. Invisible! Baba calls for the match to begin, and Mr. Invisible starts attacking him. Yamcha swipes at him, but keeps missing, while Mr. Invisible keeps landing hits. Baba wonders where all of his confidence went, and Goku does not understand how Yamcha is getting beaten up with no one else there. Krillin suddenly yells at Goku to go get Master Roshi and Bulma, and Goku asks why. Krillin tells him to not worry about it and just go. Goku flies off on Kinto-Un, and Baba wonders about him using Kinto-Un.
 See Through the Invisible Man is exposed from Roshi's nosebleed Yamcha gets hit again, and says he can just barely hear when he moves. Yamcha hears him chuckle, and manages to kick Mr. Invisible, explaining his strategy. Baba starts singing to distract Yamcha, and Mr. Invisible gets another shot in. Yamcha says that singing makes it impossible to hear the invisible man's movements, and Baba asks if he gives up. “C-crap… If I could just see him…!!”
 See Through the Invisible Man surrenders Goku returns with Master Roshi hanging from one hand and Bulma hanging from the other, and Krillin thinks he is just in time. They ask Krillin what he wants with them, and Krillin says he wants to use them for this match. He positions them so that they are facing each other, and then he gets up on the edge of the ring behind Bulma and waits for it. Krillin pulls Bulma's tube top down to expose her breasts, which makes Roshi's nose bleed, and it squirts all over Mr. Invisible. Yamcha can see him now, and so he uses his Wolf Fang Fist pounding on Mr. Invisible until he holds up a white flag. Everyone is excited, and Bulma slugs Krillin for exposing a maiden's breasts like that, and he says he was helping her boyfriend. Master Roshi says he could have killed him making an old man bleed like that, but thinks he did a good job. Baba compliments them, and laughs about her three remaining fighters.
"
The Devil's Cesspool,101,"The cover of this chapter shows a diagram of who fought who in Fortuneteller Baba's tournament.
 Bandages the Mummy appears Yamcha notices Master Roshi and Bulma are here, and Bulma asks Krillin why they are even having these matches, so he explains Fortuneteller Baba's policy to her. Then Roshi says his “Big Sister” is acting the same as always, and everyone is shocked to hear Baba's his older sister. Baba says he is still the same as always as well, he is still a sukebe (lewd person). Krilllin asks Master Roshi why they are going through such trouble when he could just ask her, but Baba says she wants money or these matches, since they are fun.
 Baba leads them inside for the next match, and on the way, Bulma asks Upa who he is, and Upa introduces himself, and she remembers that Goku is gathering the Dragon Balls to return his father to life. Krillin tells Upa that Bulma is scary, and she yells at him. They head into a building, and up a circular staircase, Master Roshi tells Yamcha they are going to the Devil's Toilet. Yamcha is a bit worried, and asks for some advice, so Roshi tells him, “Don’t die.” They come to a door, and Baba says the competitors need to go in there, and everyone else continues up the stairs.
 Yamcha and Bandages the Mummy battle There are two giant statues of some devil-type figures facing each other in this room with their tongues sticking out, and there is a small gap between the two tongues. Yamcha is in one of the mouths and below that is some gross lava stuff. Baba (who is floating over a roll of toilet paper) drops some meat in, and it disintegrates instantly, showing Yamcha that he does not want to fall in. Bulma thinks this is a messed up family, and then Baba calls out Mummy who comes out of the other mouth. “Sigh, after the invisible man is the mummy…” says Yamcha.
 Baba tells them that whoever says they give up or dies, loses, and then calls for the match to begin. Yamcha thinks he will make use of his speed and technique in this confined space to win the match. He darts across, but so does the Mummy, who jumps over him.  The mummy kicks at Yamcha from behind, but he ducks it, and Yamcha is just barely able to dodge his punches. Then the Mummy hits Yamcha in the face, and nearly knocks him off the tongue, but he manages to catch onto the edge.  The mummy thinks this match has gotten interesting.
"
Goku at the Plate!,102,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku standing, ready for battle. Fortuneteller Baba is seen floating behind him.
 Yamcha surrenders Yamcha crouches, exhausted by the speed of Bandages the Mummy, who taunts him. The others cheer him on, and he attempts to use the Rouga Whowhoken on Bandages, who easily dodges it. Bandages kicks Yamcha's feet out from under him, and jumps on him. It seems as though Yamcha has lost, but then Yamcha throws Bandages off of him and the mummy falls. Yamcha thinks he has defeated the mummy, but then Bandages uses his bandages to catch hold of one of the tongues of the stone demons and swings himself back up. He taunts the stunned Yamcha before hitting him and kneeing him in the stomach. Bandages tells Yamcha to give up or he will drop him into the poison swamp below. Yamcha finally surrenders.
 Yamcha reunites with the others, panting, and he apologizes to Goku for being unable to defeat Bandages. Fortuneteller Baba asks who the last of the fighters in Goku's group is, and Goku eagerly points out that it is his turn. Upa tells Goku to stop, fearful that he will die, but Goku insists on fighting and runs down to the arena. Baba announces the start of the match, and Bandages seems confident he will win, but notices that Goku's stance, though casual, conveys that he has no openings.
"
The Power of Goku,103,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku and Bandages the Mummy in fighting stances. Baba is seen in the corner.
 Goku lands a devastating punch to Bandages the Mummy Goku and Bandages are about to fight one another in Devil's Toilet. Goku confidently urges Bandages the Mummy to attack him, which makes Bandages hesitate for a moment, apprehensive of Goku. Fortuneteller Baba impatiently tells them to start, and Bandages lunges forward and punches Goku, who takes the hit head-on. Goku is kicked by Bandages and hits the head of one of the stone demons while Yamcha, Krillin, Master Roshi, and the others watch on, horrified. Goku lays motionless on the tongue of the stone demon, and Bandages scoffs about how easy an opponent Goku was. Baba states that Goku will lose if he is unconscious and asks for a reply from Goku to confirm whether he is down for the count or not. Goku gets back up, shocking Baba and Bandages, and he eagerly winds up for his turn to hit Bandages. Goku walks forward and Master Roshi and Puar discuss with one another how astounded they are that Goku took no damage from Bandages' brutal attacks.
 Spike the Devil Man Bandages tries to punch Goku, only to miss when the boy ducks to evade the punch. Goku punches Bandages and connects with the mummy's stomach, knocking the wind out of him and seemingly incapacitating the mummy. Goku lifts Bandages with little effort, shocking Baba even further, and Goku asks Bandages to reply. When the latter does not reply, Baba reluctantly declares that Goku has won the match, and the boy cheerfully carries Bandages out of the way so they can prepare for the next match. Goku's friends watch, shocked at how easy the battle was for Goku. They muse that Goku incapacitating the mummy with one blow is impossible, and Master Roshi remarks on Goku's incredible strength. Spike the Devil Man and a masked fighter look on from within a stone demon's mouth, where Spike muses on Goku's strength, but is confident that Goku will not be able to defeat him.
 Baba introduces Akkuman as her fourth contestant, and Goku remarks on the strange appearances attributed to Baba's fighters. Master Roshi comments on it, surprised that Akkuman, who is usually Baba's fifth and final contestant, is out so early, meaning Baba has found an even stronger fighter to surpass him. Baba announces the beginning of the match.
 Akkuman flies in the air above Goku, catching him by surprise. Akkuman taunts Goku and then launches himself at the boy, claws outstretched. Goku counters it with a well-aimed kick that catches Baba and his friends by surprise, and Yamcha remarks on Goku's speed, which has left Akkuman surprised.
"
The Beam of Evil,104,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku standing in the center, arms crossed. Seen behind him are Master Roshi, Puar, Bulma, Upa, Yamcha and Krillin.
 Spike the Devil Man fires his Devilmite Beam Spike the Devil Man is surprised by Goku's speed, but lunges at Goku once again, only to miss. He tries kicking Goku, to no avail as the boy quickly dodges the attack. Akkuman tries to attack Goku, but the boy's sheer speed is too much for him, and he is punched by Goku, nearly being knocked out of the ring by Goku. An exhausted Akkuman manages to fly back up to meet Goku. Goku's party is in disbelief at Goku's strength, and Fortuneteller Baba chastises Akkuman for his performance. Akkuman smiles, confusing Goku, and he prepares to use his Devilmite Beam on Goku. Master Roshi yells for Goku to watch out, and Baba yells to Akkuman not to take it too far. The beam connects with Goku, and all are concerned, but the attack brings no results, as Goku's heart is pure, and Akkuman's attack is thus rendered useless against Goku. The others are relieved by this, and Baba is shocked at how pure Goku's heart must be, but Akkuman is furious. He resorts to attempting to use his Demon Fork to kill Goku, and Goku comments on this being unfair, but Akkuman's attempt on Goku's life ultimately fails when Goku's attack both knocks him out of the ring and incapacitates him, causing Goku to wonder if he overdid the attack and leaving Roshi and Baba stunned.
"
The Last Champion,105,"The cover of this chapter shows someone wearing a mask in the running position. He has a halo above his head. Goku is seen behind him, doing the same pose.
 Goku and company celebrate Goku's victory against Akkuman, and Fortuneteller Baba is flustered, but confident that her last fighter will defeat Goku. The masked man reveals himself, shocking Goku and the others due to his appearance. The masked fighter then asks Baba if the battle can take place outside, for Devil's Toilet is too cramped for him to fight Goku with his full potential. Baba accepts the request, and she leads them to an outdoor ring. On the way there, Krillin expresses his belief that Goku will easily defeat the masked man. Goku then notices that the masked man has a nice smell. Yamcha then points out that Master Roshi has been quiet, and Roshi explains that the masked fighter seems familiar. Baba is surprised by something the masked fighter tells her, and Goku is impatient and eager to fight.
 Goku and the mysterious fifth man off Baba tells them to prepare for the match and the masked fighter bows to Goku, then asks him if he is going to do a pre-match bow. Goku bows to him, surprised by this. Baba calls the beginning of the match, and Goku and the masked fighter stare each other down. The others watch, enthused, and Goku charges at the masked fighter when the latter prompts him to.
 The masked fighter almost strikes Goku, and the boy only barely dodges. Goku tries to punch him, only for the masked fighter to catch hold of Goku's fist. The two leap back, and the masked fighter leaps high over Goku, alarming the boy. With great speed, the masked fighter lunges at Goku and punches him. Goku barely catches himself from the punch and flips, throwing himself at the masked fighter and kicking him. The two leap back, and Goku's party watches, stunned.
"
Strong vs. Strong,106,"The cover of this chapter shows many little squares on it. Some squares contain letters that eventually spell out Dragon Ball. These squares are separated by squares containing characters, such as Krillin, Baba, Shenron, Upa, Yamcha, Bulma, Grandpa Gohan, Master Roshi, Oolong, Puar, and Goku. This cover art is also featured in Daizenshuu 1. Shenron was originally colored blue, but was changed to green in the Full Color release.
 Goku and the mysterious masked fighter stare each other down. Goku's friends are stunned by the incredible fighting displayed by both Goku and the masked fighter. The masked fighter then charges at Goku, trying to hit him, and Goku kicks the masked fighter. The masked fighter grabs Goku's leg, slams him into the ground, then flings him into the sky. Goku's friends are surprised by this, and wonder what the masked fighter will do next. The masked fighter flies up to Goku and kicks him back to the ground, hard, thinking Goku will not be able to brush the attack off. Much to his surprise, Goku flies up in the air and kicks him, almost knocking him into a building. The masked fighter quickly recovers from the hit before hitting the structure, and launches himself forward, about to kick Goku. Instead of dodging or blocking it, Goku takes the kick head-on. This excites Goku and unnerves the masked fighter, who is surprised that Goku was able to toughen himself up so much. The masked fighter then surprises Goku and the others by firing a Kamehameha at Goku. Goku surprises everyone by using the Afterimage Technique to evade the masked fighter's attack.
"
To Win By a Tail,107,"The cover of this chapter shows a fighter jumping into the air. Goku is seen in the position to do the Kamehameha.
 After Goku uses the Afterimage Technique to dodge the masked fighter's Kamehameha, the masked fighter is in disbelief, but notes that it restricts Goku's maneuverability. Just as the masked fighter is about to take advantage of the situation by firing a Kamehameha at Goku, he notices that Goku is about to fire a Kamehameha of his own, which surprises the fighter. Goku fires his Kamehameha, hitting the fighter. He demands that the fighter give up before he finishes him off himself, when the fighter reaches out and grabs Goku by the tail, weakening him. Yamcha explains that Goku loses his power when his tail is grabbed, and wonders how the fighter recognized Goku's tail as his weakness. Master Roshi realizes who the fighter really is, just as the fighter slams Goku into the ground by his tail.
 Meanwhile, Emperor Pilaf, who is watching the battle from a screen, overhears that Goku's weakness is his tail and is overjoyed. He reveals that he has one of the seven Dragon Balls in a special case which supposedly cloaks it on the Dragon Radar, preventing Goku from gathering all seven. Pilaf, Shu, and Mai then leave to seek out Goku and steal what Dragon Balls he has.
 Goku refuses to surrender, and Roshi reveals that the masked fighter is actually Gohan, the late adoptive grandfather of Goku. As Grandpa Gohan swings Goku around by the tail and slamming him into the ground, Goku's tail rips off.
"
Son Gohan,108,"The cover of this chapter shows characters like Goku, Master Roshi, Krillin and Yamcha. Grandpa Gohan is seen taking off his mask.
 Goku cries out in pain, his tail having just been unintentionally ripped off by the masked warrior, who is actually Grandpa Gohan, unbeknownst to Goku. Roshi deduces that this means Goku no longer has a weak spot. Yamcha, Bulma, and the others are shocked about the masked warrior's identity, in disbelief because Grandpa Gohan is supposed to be dead. Roshi points out the halo over Gohan's head. Goku, meanwhile, is angered about the loss of his tail and prepares to fight Grandpa Gohan, who then surrenders. Grandpa Gohan then shocks Goku by revealing his true identity and removing the mask. Goku is overjoyed, and hugs his adoptive grandfather, then cries. Grandpa Gohan then chastises Goku for not overcoming the weakness of his tail sooner.
 Grandpa Gohan reveals himself Goku asks Gohan how he was revived, and Gohan explains that he is still dead, but Fortuneteller Baba brought him from the afterlife to fight matches for her. Goku asks Grandpa Gohan to live with him again, but then Gohan reveals that he is only back from the afterlife for a day. It is revealed that Fortuneteller Baba intentionally chose to pit Gohan up against Goku, by Gohan's request. Gohan thanks Roshi for training and watching over Goku, and then asks him if Goku has been transforming into a Great Ape, upon which Roshi states that he has things under control.
 Goku then shows Grandpa Gohan his amassed collection of Dragon Balls, and Bulma explains how the Dragon Balls changed Goku's life. Upa feels bad about having his father alone be revived while Goku's grandfather is dead, to which Gohan responds that he is fond of the afterlife, hinting that women might be the reason that is so. Gohan then bids Goku and the others farewell before returning to the afterlife.
 Fortuneteller Baba then uses her powers to locate the remaining Dragon Ball for Goku and company. Her crystal ball shows the car that Emperor Pilaf, Shu, and Mai, who plan to steal Goku's Dragon Balls, are traveling in, and Bulma ponders why the Dragon Ball did not show up on the Dragon Radar. Baba then reveals the ball is not far off, and is moving towards them.
"
A Second Helping of Pilaf,109,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku standing with Emperor Pilaf, Shu and Mai inside three rectangles to the side of him.
 The Pilaf Gang in their Pilaf Machines Goku decides to go find the car the remaining Dragon Ball is in. Yamcha questions how easy finding the car with the Dragon Ball in it will be, and Fortuneteller Baba explains that not many cars pass through the area it is in. While Bulma is still confused about why the Dragon Ball is not appearing on the Dragon Radar, Goku rides off on the Flying Nimbus to go and locate the seventh and final Dragon Ball they need to collect.
 Meanwhile, Emperor Pilaf explains to Shu and Mai that they will grab Goku's tail to weaken him, and then steal the Dragon Balls from Goku and company. When Shu asks what he will do when he is in control of the world, Pilaf is indecisive.
 Goku notices the car and jumps down from the Flying Nimbus onto the roof of it. As Pilaf, Shu, and Mai wonder what caused the noise, Goku hangs off of the roof of the car upside down and asks for their Dragon Ball, which surprises them. Just as Goku thinks he recognizes them, Mai abruptly turns the car, throwing Goku off of the roof. Pilaf, Shu, and Mai wonder how Goku has found them, Pilaf believing that Goku should not have found them due to the Dragon Ball being in a special box that cloaked it from the Dragon Radar.
 Goku attacks Emperor Pilaf Goku recognizes them finally, and Mai wonders what they will do, but Pilaf thinks that Goku's decision to come alone is advantageous for them, as they know his weakness and he is their biggest threat in the group. Goku demands that they come out and face him, and he faces off against the three of them. Goku then demands that they give him the Dragon Ball. Pilaf refuses, saying if Goku wins in a fight against him, he will give Goku the ball, but if Goku loses he has to turn over his six Dragon Balls.
 Pilaf, Shu, and Mai throw down capsules, each of which is a Pilaf Machine. Goku is confident, turning down Pilaf's demand to surrender. Pilaf explains the machines are powerful, but Goku remains undaunted. As Pilaf insists that Mai attack Goku first, Goku kicks Pilaf's machine and sends it flying into a cliff face, surprising Pilaf. Shu and Mai rush to his aid.
"
The Pilaf Machine,110,"The cover of this chapter shows Master Roshi, Yamcha, Krillin, Goku, Puar, Bulma and Oolong all running forward. This cover art is also featured in Daizenshuu 1.
 The Pilaf Machines are combined Emperor Pilaf decides to cut right to their plan of defeating Goku by using the weakness of his tail against him, unaware that Grandpa Gohan had ripped it off. As the three position themselves, Shu points out that he cannot see Goku's tail, speculating it may be hidden under his clothes. Pilaf calls a time-out and huddles with Shu and Mai, determining a back-up plan.
 Goku fires a Kamehameha at the Fused Pilaf Machine As they corner him again, Goku remains confident. Pilaf temporarily distracts Goku, allowing Mai to grab him. Shu shoots fire at Goku's rear end, which they hope will expose his tail as they have burned his pants off. Pilaf reaches to grab Goku's tail, realizing that Goku no longer has a tail, just as the half-naked Goku breaks free.
 Goku destroys the Pilaf Machine and retrieves the Dragon Ball Pilaf asks Goku what happened to his tail, to which Goku responds that it got ripped off. They decide to take Goku on and hope they can win by sheer strength alone. They merge their Pilaf Machines into one large combat machine, with Pilaf's machine as the head, Mai's machine as the torso, and Shu's machine as the legs. Goku fires a Kamehameha at them, destroying the merged Pilaf Machine's left arm, much to the horror of Pilaf and cronies. The Kamehameha blast greatly damaged Mai's machine, rendering it useless. Pilaf and Shu detach their machine's from Mai's and merge the two alone, with Mai leaping out of her machine and hopping on the new fused machine.
 Goku charges towards them, and Shu fires a missile at Goku. Goku then grabs the missile and throws it back at them, destroying the remaining Pilaf machines. Pilaf turns over the Dragon Ball to Goku, and when Goku demands some clothes, Shu gives Goku his clothes.

 Bora is brought back to life Goku returns to the others on the Flying Nimbus with the final Dragon Ball, and he tells Upa to come with him to Korin Tower. The two boys board the Flying Nimbus and set off for their destination. The others talk about Goku, and Fortuneteller Baba reveals that she had a vague premonition that Goku will someday save the world.
 Goku and Upa reach Korin Tower and head to the base of it, where the grave of Bora is located. Goku lays out the Dragon Balls together, and Goku yells for Shenron to come. The sky grows dark, and the reunition of the seven Dragon Balls summons Shenron. Shenron asks them what they wish for, and Upa asks Shenron to revive his father. Bora rises from his grave, revived.

"Go, Goku, Go!",112,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku in a jumping pose in front of two rectangles that contain Bora and Upa in one, and Yamcha, Master Roshi, Krillin, Fortuneteller Baba and Bulma in the other.
 Upa and Bora are reunited Goku watches as Upa tearfully reunites with his father. Upa explains to Bora that Goku gathered the Dragon Balls and wished him back to life. He notices Shenron, who then departs. Goku watches as the Dragon Balls are about to disperse, his eyes set on the Four Star Ball, then when the balls disperse, he jumps up and grabs it. Upa asks Goku why he jumped, to which Goku explained that the balls disperse when the wish is made, and explains that he was grabbing the Four Star, which belonged to his grandfather at one point. He shows Upa the ball, which has turned into a rock, and explains that the balls become rocks for a year after the wish has been made. Bora thanks Goku, and Upa tells his father how Goku climbed Korin Tower and killed the man who murdered Bora. Goku then leaves on the Flying Nimbus, and as Bora and Upa bid Goku farewell, Bora asks Upa to live as robustly as Goku from now on.
 The Dragon Balls disperse Krillin notices Goku is coming, and asks how it went. Goku confirms Bora's revival, and then runs a short distance away from them and urinates, prompting Krillin to wonder if Goku will really be the one to save the world as Fortuneteller Baba's premonition said. Puar states that Goku's Dragon Ball collecting is finally over, and Bulma remarks that Goku will search for his grandfather's Four Star Ball again. Goku responds by showing them the rock that is now the Four Star and explaining that he jumped up and caught it before it could disperse with the others.
 The adventure is only just beginning... Goku then tells the others he will train for the World Martial Arts Tournament, and Yamcha tells Goku about how he will begin training under Master Roshi. Goku is excited that they will all be training together, but Master Roshi then tells Goku to go out in the world and discover things, as Goku is already quite skilled and he feels Goku would become stronger by discovering how to on his own. Roshi says they will meet at the next tournament, and asks Goku to astound him with his new strength. When Krillin disappointedly asks about not seeing Goku for five years, Roshi explains that the increasing number of contestants has prompted the tournament to now be held every three years instead.
 Goku says farewell to each of his friends, and Krillin remarks about how he will be taller than Goku when they meet again. Goku calls the Flying Nimbus, but Roshi instead requests that Goku make his journey without the help of the Flying Nimbus. Goku is indifferent, and runs off. When Baba asks Roshi if he will allow Goku to surpass him, Roshi then insists that the others and he run back to the Kame House, and they do so, Bulma wondering how she got mixed up in it. The last panel shows Goku running and explains how Goku has gone on a journey to become even stronger, how Krillin and Yamcha are throwing themselves fully into training with Master Roshi, and about how they will meet again in another three years at the next World Martial Arts Tournament.

Return to the Tournament,113,"Bulma, Turtle, Yamcha, Oolong, Goku, Master Roshi, Krillin, Puar and Launch can all be seen on the cover of this chapter.
 Chiaotzu, Master Shen, and Tien An airplane is seen flying through the sky. In it, is Master Roshi, Yamcha, and the others. The pilot informs them that they will soon be at the airport on Papaya Island they will reach prior to the World Martial Arts Tournament. As Yamcha, Krillin and Master Roshi banter about who will win, Bulma reminds them about Goku. Launch (as Bad Launch) angrily remarks that riding on planes makes her want to hijack them. Master Roshi asks a stewardess when they are going to land because he needs to use the restroom, and urges the plane to hurry when she asks him to hold it a while longer.
 Goku returning to the World Tournament Stadium The scene cuts to Yamcha, Krillin and the others waiting outside of the airport's restroom for Roshi, complaining that he is taking too long and participant registration will close soon. Roshi returns from the restroom, loudly exclaiming that he had a difficult time defecating, which embarrasses Bulma. They then take a cab.
 They arrive at the World Martial Arts Tournament and register. Master Roshi asks the man handling registration if a boy named Goku has registered yet, to which they discover he has not. As they wait for Goku, Roshi secretly asks the registration man to register him as Jackie Chun, asking the man to tell no one. Krillin notices Roshi's small disappearance, and Roshi then insists he was urinating.
 Master Shen then arrives, with Tien Shinhan and Chiaotzu in tow. Shen then insults Roshi, remarking how the tournament must have gotten pathetic for Roshi's disciples to be successful in it. He then states his disciples will be the winners of this tournament, and Roshi laughs, believing it to be a joke. The two then yell insults at each other, and Shen and his disciples depart. Yamcha asks Roshi who it was, and Roshi explains that Shen is his longtime rival.
 Krillin, Yamcha, and Goku get dressed into their Turtle School uniforms As there is one minute left to register, they determine Goku will not make it on time, and Yamcha orders Puar to change into Goku so they can at least register him. Just then, Launch notices Goku coming, clad in new clothes and with his tail grown back. They comment on how Goku is grown, and Goku notices with surprise how much Bulma has grown. Roshi asks Goku what happened to the Flying Nimbus, and Goku reveals that because of Roshi previously telling him not to use it, he swam to Papaya Island from Yahhoy, on the other side of the Earth. They then hear an announcement telling all participants to enter the competition hall for the preliminaries.
 Goku, Yamcha, and Krillin change into their Turtle School Uniforms and Krillin and Yamcha wonder if Goku has gotten any stronger over the past three years. Bulma, Oolong, Launch, Roshi, and Puar peer over the wall to wish them all good luck, and Roshi tells them to use everything they have learned over the past three years.
 The three of them enter the competition hall. Meanwhile, with the others, Puar notices Roshi is missing, and Bulma tells him Roshi is probably in the bathroom. Roshi is, in fact, in the competition hall, disguised as Jackie Chun. Goku comes up to him and proclaims his hope that he will beat Jackie Chun this time. The contestants are then informed that of the one hundred and eighty two of them, only eight will advance to the actual tournament.

The Qualifying Rounds,114,"The cover of this chapter shows Krillin, Yamcha and Goku in fighting poses.
 The drawings begin, and Kuririn gets #71, in the second half of Block Two. Goku gets in the end of Block One, and Yamcha draws in the first half of Block One. Goku asks Jackie what he got, and he says #178, in Block Four. Then the PA system says they’re going to decide the eight finalists, and so everyone needs to get to their proper blocks. The rules are then explained: “The fights are one-on-one atop the contest platforms. If you fall off, faint, or say you give up, it’s a loss.” They all go to their blocks, and the official at Block One calls for #1 and #2, and Yamcha steps up. The opponent comes at Yamcha, but one elbow to the face knocks him out, and the official says #2 wins.
 Krillin easily wins Yamcha and Goku look over at Kuririn, and this huge guy is calling him a baldy baby. The guy tries to smash Kuririn with his huge hand, but Kuririn just slings him overhead by one of his huge fingers, tossing the guy into the wall. Goku compliments Kuririn, when the three-eyed guy from Tsuru-sennin’s party comes over and starts talking trash. Goku doesn’t know who he is, and Kuririn tells him it’s one of Tsuru-sennin’s students, who is Muten Rōshi’s rival. The three-eyed guy tells them they’re lucky they won’t end up fighting him in the preliminaries, and then talks some more trash. Yamcha gives him the finger, and then #99 and #100 are called in Block Three, and the guy says it’s his turn.
 The three-eyed guy takes off his coat, and Kuririn says he’ll laugh if he loses, but Goku thinks he looks like an awesome guy. The three-eyed guy has to fight a sumo wrestler, but he defeats him in the blink of an eye. The official says #99 wins, and most of the onlookers didn’t notice anything. But Kuririn and Yamcha note it was four hand strikes and two kicks, and the three-eyed guy thinks that was nothing. Then it’s Goku’s turn, and he’s faced up against the famous King Chapa.
 The Dragon Quest monsters Saber tiger, Orc, Shaman, Cyclops, and Archdemon are contestants in the preliminaries of the 22nd World Martial Arts Tournament. Those monsters were designed by Akira Toriyama, and are all originally from Dragon Quest II (1987). Shaman and Killer also appear in the following manga chapter, ""King Chappa"".
"
King Chappa,115,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku ready to fight King Chappa, and Yamcha talking to Jackie Chun.
 Jackie Chun defeats his opponent (Shaman and Saber Tiger in the background) Apparently, Jackie Chun has heard of King Chappa and thinks this will be a troublesome match for Goku, even if it is his first. Goku flies at Chappa and punches him in the face, but it does not knock Chappa down. Yamcha says it is gotten serious, and Jackie says Chappa is going to use Eight-Arm Fist. Yamcha has heard of that, apparently the user moves so fast that it looks as if they have eight arms. Chappa comes at Goku using this attack, but Goku manages to dodge all of this blows. Goku then sweep kicks Chappa off his feet. Chappa swings at Goku, but misses because Goku jumps up in the air. Goku kicks off the ceiling and dives down at Chappa, then kicks him and knocks him off the platform. The official says it is #28's win.
 Yamcha and Krillin (Shaman shown in the background) Yamcha and Jackie can not believe how easily Goku defeated King Chappa, and Goku wants to see how strong they have all gotten over the years. It is Jackie Chun's turn, and he knocks out a bear fighter for the victory. Yamcha says he has improved since last time, and thinks that this World Martial Arts Tournament has gotten even more amazing than the last one.
 The preliminaries continue with the three Turtle School students making it into the final eight, along with Jackie Chun. The three of them run outside to greet the others, and Bulma congratulates them. Kuririn asks where Master Roshi is, and Bulma says he is probably off being a pervert in this crowd. As he shows up, Roshi says ""Who'd you say was a pervert!?"", and he then compliments his students work in the preliminaries. Then, the PA system calls the finalists back, and so they leave. Oolong says they will not have a problem seeing everything with Launch (bad) around. Launch than starts firing off her pistol to clear a path through the crowd.
 Like in the previous chapter, ""The Qualifying Rounds"", the Dragon Quest monsters Shaman and Saber tiger appear as contestants in the preliminaries of the 22nd World Martial Arts Tournament. Those monsters were designed by Akira Toriyama, and are originally from Dragon Quest II (1987).
"
The Doctored Lottery,116,"The cover of this chapter shows the participants of the 22nd World Martial Arts Tournament. These characters include Goku, Jackie Chun, Krillin, Yamcha, Chiaotzu, Tien Shinhan, Pamput and Man-Wolf.
 Backstage, Goku balances on his hands while Kuririn, Yamcha, and Jackie stand around, when the three-eyed guy shows up and starts mocking the “Dumb Kame Team”. He and Yamcha argue a bit, and Kuririn tells the little guy he can’t believe he made it past the preliminaries. So, the little guy calls him baldy, and Kuririn yells at him that he’s bald too, right? The little guy takes off his little hat, and Kuririn yells at him that it’s just one hair. “Jealous?” Then the three-eyed guy pulls the little guy aside, calling him Chiaotzu, as he’s sticking his tongue out at the pissed off Kuririn.
 The matches of the World Martial Arts Tournament are made The announcer shows up, and calls all the participants over. “Ossu!” The announcer recognizes Goku, and asks him to please not bust up the arena this time. He explains that they’ll have a lottery to determine opponents and match order, and to come forward when your name is called. First he calls up Jackie Chun, and the three-eyed guy tells Chiaotzu that he was winner last time, and he wants to see him in action first. The three-eyed guy looks over at an angry wolf guy, who apparently has a grudge against Jackie Chun, so he tells Chiaotzu to match the wolf up against Jackie to make it interesting. Jackie draws #4, in the second match, and then Yamcha is called up. The three-eyed guy wants to fight him, so Chiaotzu uses some kind of telekinesis to make him draw #1, the first match. Panput is called up next and Chiaotzu puts him at #7, in the fourth match.
 The 22nd World Martial Arts Tournament commences Next is Tenshinhan, the three-eyed guy, and Chiaotzu puts him at #2 so he’ll fight Yamcha in the first match. Next, Kuririn is called, and Chiaotzu puts him at #6, in the third match. Next, the announcer calls Wolf-Man, and the wolf guy yells that it’s Man-Wolf. He explains that a wolf man turns into a wolf at the full moon, but he turns into a human at the full moon. Chiaotzu makes him draw #3, so he’ll fight Jackie Chun in the second match. The announcer calls Gyōza (chaozu is the Chinese reading for gyōza) next, and Chiaotzu corrects him, then draws #5, putting him in the third match with Kuririn. Kuririn’s relieved to be fighting that little guy instead of Goku. The announcer looks at the chart, and says all that’s left is Son Goku, and he’ll draw #8 to be in the fourth match against Panput. “Huh!? How do you know I’ll get #8?” says Goku. He goes and draws, and he’s impressed that he really did get #8.
 Tenshinhan makes fun of Kame-Sen’nin’s place, as the announcer explains the rules. “Falling from the ring, being down for a ten count, or giving up is a loss.” Then he prepares to leave, and asks Goku if he wants a meal before the match again, and Goku responds with “Eat, eat!!” Tenshinhan continues to make fun of them for that, and tells Chiaotzu he looks forward to their matches. Kuririn thinks the four of them (Kuririn, Yamcha, Goku, and Jackie) will be the ones to advance to the semifinals.
 Out in the crowd, Oolong wonders where the old man is, and Pu’er thanks Lunch (good) for getting them this great spot. But she doesn’t understand, since it was the bad one who got the seats. The gongs suddenly sound and the announcer comes out. “Ladies and gentleman, so sorry to have kept you waiting for such an awfully long time!! But now we’re back, and we’ll begin the twenty-second Tenka’ichi Budōkai!!!” He explains that the one hundred eighty-two contestants in the preliminaries are now down to eight, and that there’s a five hundred thousand zenni prize. “Well then, we’ll begin the first match!! It’s Yamcha versus Tenshinhan!!” They both come out, and the onlookers are amazed at the idea of Tsuru-sennin and Kame-Sen’nin’s students fighting. Tenshinhan and Yamcha both think this’ll be fun.
"
Yamcha's Kamehameha!,117,"The cover of this chapter shows Tien Shinhan and Yamcha in fighting positions.
 Tien and Yamcha battle They stare each other down, then Yamcha flies at him with a kick, but Tenshinhan blocks it, and Yamcha is just barely able to dodge his jabs. Tenshinhan kicks him, and Yamcha does some back flips. Tenshinhan flies at him, kicking off the wall, and punches at him, but Yamcha jumps up out of the way. So, Tenshinhan flies up after him, but Yamcha dodges his attacks and hits him down towards the ground. They each land, and the audience is impressed as the two of them each wonder about the other.
 Yamcha fires a kamehameha at Tien Yamcha announces his Shin Rōga Fū-Fū Ken, and Tenshinhan thinks it sounds interesting. They fly at each other, and Tenshinhan manages to block all of his attacks, and hits Yamcha hard in the gut, knocking him down. But Yamcha gets back up again, and prepares for his next attack. Kuririn wonders what he’s doing, and Goku says it’s the Kamehameha, and Jackie Chun is intrigued. “Ka…me…ha…me…ha!!!” Yamcha fires it off, and Tenshinhan folds his hands in front of himself with his index fingers out, preparing to take the Kamehameha head on.
"
The Cruelty of Tenshinhan,118,"The cover of this chapter shows a graph of which fighters will fight each other in the 22nd World Martial Arts Tournament.
 Tien uses Kiai to deflect Yamcha's kamehameha Everyone watches as Tenshinhan stands firm and bounces the Kamehameha back Yamcha’s way. Yamcha is just barely able to jump up to avoid it, and Tenshinhan follows him as the Kamehameha hits a building. Yamcha’s pissed about the deflection, and Goku yells for him to look out. Tenshinhan’s mid-air right next to him, and he kicks Yamcha and tosses him back down to the ring. Yamcha lands really hard and he’s knocked out. Tenshinhan comes down, landing knee first on Yamcha’s leg, breaking it.
 Tien breaks Yamcha's leg Goku runs in the ring, and the announcer comes in worried as well, while Tenshinhan just smugly asks the results. “Y-Yamcha is unable to continue the match in his condition. T-therefore, it’s Tenshinhan’s win…!!” The announcer tells a guy that the leg is broken and he needs to be taken to a hospital, and Pu’er flies in, saying he’ll do so. Pu’er changes into a magic carpet, and Goku and Kuririn help Yamcha onto it. Pu’er flies off with him and Bulma says she’s going to follow.
 Goku’s pissed, and Tenshinhan says he should be thankful he’s such a nice man and he didn’t kill him. Goku says he’ll get him, but Tenshinhan just laughs and leaves the ring, doubting Goku will make it to the finals. Tsuru-sennin is pleased with this, and thinks Kame-Sen’nin must be getting pale.
 “W-well then, we’ll begin the second match. It’s Jackie Chun versus Man-Wolf!” Man-Wolf heads out first, glaring at Jackie on the way. Chiaotzu gives Tenshinhan the peace sign, and Tenshinhan says it was only natural, but he’d thought the Kame-sen Style would be better than that. He tells Chiaotzu that Yamcha was probably the best of Kame-Sen’nin’s three students, so he’ll probably be the winner, and Chiaotzu will be the runner up.
"
The Full Moon Grudge,119,"The cover of this chapter shows Jackie Chun and Man-Wolf, with the moon in the corner.
 Tien and Chiaotzu flying The announcer explains that Chun won the tournament last time and that Man-Wolf transforms from a wolf to a man if he looks at the full moon. Jackie wonders why this guy he has never met before is so furious with him, and Man-Wolf explains that Chun blew up the moon at the last Tenka’ichi Budōkai. So, he’s stuck as a wolf and can’t hook up with any cute human girls. Jackie says he could find a wolf girlfriend, but Man-Wolf says he hates hairy women.
 “Well then, please begin the second match!!” Man-Wolf swipes at Jackie, but Jackie ducks it, jumps over another one, and then kicks him in the back of the head, knocking him into the ground. Man-Wolf is enraged, and Tenshinhan and Chiaotzu look on, with Tenshinhan not seeming particularly impressed with the previous winner. Kuririn points out to Goku that those two (Tenshinhan and Chiaotzu) are floating, and Goku is impressed.
 Man Wolf rings himself out Man-Wolf runs at Jackie from behind (who’s looking at a girl), but Jackie just back flips over him, kicking him in the back of the head again, and goes back to looking at the girl. Man-Wolf gets up and starts punching at him, but Jackie keeps dodging, then kicks Man-Wolf into the wall and asks for the count. The count gets up to seven, when Man-Wolf gets back up and pulls out a knife. The announcer says the use of weapons is foul play. Man-Wolf jabs at Jackie with the knife, but he dodges it. He grabs the knife, lifts it up, and swings Man-Wolf off of it and he crashes into the wall. Jackie throws the knife into the wall, right next to Man-Wolf.
 Man Wolf becomes a human again through Krillin's bald head Jackie says he’ll turn him into a human, and Man-Wolf doesn’t believe him. Jackie asks for his paw, and Man-Wolf gives it to him, but takes it away, yelling he’s not a dog. Then Jackie asks him to beg, and he does, but reacts angrily again. Then Jackie pulls out a bone, and tosses it out of the ring, and Man-Wolf runs to fetch it. “Ring out!! It’s Jackie’s win!!”
 Still furious with Jackie, Man-Wolf runs back in the ring, but Jackie uses Kanashibari no Jutsu (Binding Technique) to freeze him in his place. Kuririn wonders how he’ll turn him into a human without the moon as Jackie calls him over. Jackie positions Kuririn facing backwards in front of Man-Wolf, and Kuririn realizes he’s going to use his head as a replacement for a full moon, and mentions Goku might transform as well. But Jackie uses hypnosis on Man-Wolf, making Kuririn’s head look like the full moon to him, and he turns back into a human. Man-Wolf is so happy. He thanks Jackie and then runs off to be a skirt chaser. Jackie thinks he would have been better off as a wolf (since he’s so ugly). “Now then, next we’ll begin the third match!! It’s Chiaotzu versus the full moon-headed Kuririn!” Kuririn is not too thrilled with that label.
"
Look Out! The Dodon Blast!,120,"The cover of this chapter shows Chiaotzu and Krillin facing off.
 Chiaotzu fires a barrage of dodon ray's at Krillin The announcer says that Kuririn is a student of Kame-Sen’nin, and Chiaotzu is a student of his rival, Tsuru-Sen’nin. “Well then, please begin!!” Kuririn takes a fighting stance, but Chiaotzu stands unmoving with no expression on his face. Kuririn wonders what is going on, and then Chiaotzu slides forward and kicks Kuririn into the air. Chiaotzu flies up and swings at him, but Kuririn back flips back to the ground, then he kicks off the ground and comes swinging back up at Chiaotzu. Chiaotzu dodges and Kuririn flies over him, then Chiaotzu floats down to the ground.
 Kuririn comes down again and kicks off the ring, dashing at Chiaotzu, and then Kuririn vanishes. Tenshinhan yells to watch out on the left, but Chiaotzu has to think which one that is. By the time he figures it out, Kuririn reappears and slugs him in the face. Kuririn gets in a few good hits, and then Chiaotzu flies backwards and up into the air. Jackie recognizes that as the Tsuru-sen Style's signature technique, Bukūjutsu. Tenshinhan is impressed with the knowledge of kisama (very insulting ""you"" in Japanese), and Goku says to not say kisama but ""Gramps"".
 Krillins first attempt at a kamehameha fails Kuririn wonders what to do, and Chiaotzu tells him he will surprise him with this attack. Chiaotzu holds up one finger, and it starts to flare up, then he fires a Dodonpa down at Kuririn. Kuririn jumps out of the way and Chiaotzu keeps firing off a bunch more, that Kuririn also barely dodges. Goku recognizes it as Tao Pai-pai's technique, and Tenshinhan asks Goku about this. Goku says he defeated Tao Pai-pai, and after some doubt, Tenshinhan thinks about Tao Pai-pai and walks away. Jackie asks if he really did take out Tao Pai-pai, and Goku assures him he did. Then Jackie tells him Tao Pai-pai is Tsuru-Sen’nin's little brother.
 Kuririn keeps jumping out of the way of the multiple Dodonpa that Chiaotzu keeps firing at him, and is annoyed that Chiaotzu is not using his hands and feet. Meanwhile, Tenshinhan makes his way through the crowd to Tsuru-Sen’nin, and says he has something to tell him. Kuririn thinks about using a Kamehameha, but remembers what happened with Yamcha. He prepares to use it, but then another Dodonpa comes his way. Tsuru-Sen’nin is shocked at what Tenshinhan has just told him, and yells out for Chiaotzu to take this guy out. So, Chiaotzu prepares to fire off a really powerful Dodonpa down at Kuririn. But then Kuririn calls out “Ka…me…ha…”, and Jackie can not believe he can also use the Kamehameha.
"
Kuririn's Master Plan,121,"The cover of this chapter shows Jackie Chun, Krillin in a fighting pose, Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu, Pamput in a fighting position, and Goku.
 Chiaotzu is hit by Krillins kamehameha Chiaotzu performs telekinesis on Krillin Chiaotzu fires the Dodonpa down at Kuririn while Tenshinhan and Tsuru-Sen’nin smirk, and Jackie’s really worried. “Now!!” yells Kuririn and he jumps up into the air as the Dodonpa hits the ring and causes a big explosion. Kuririn has jumped up to Chiaotzu’s level, where he finally unleashes his Kamehameha and it’s a direct hit. Kuririn celebrates as Chiaotzu hurtles towards the ground outside the ring. But Chiaotzu stops himself and flies back to the ring. Jackie’s impressed with Kuririn’s work, and Kuririn and Chiaotzu stare each other down. Tenshinhan’s pissed that he avoided the Dodonpa.
 Chiaotzu's super dodon blast Kuririn rushes at Chiaotzu with a kick, but Chiaotzu ducks it. So, Kuririn does a vertical kick this time, knocking Chiaotzu across the ring. Kuririn charges after him, but then Chiaotzu holds out his hands and Kuririn freezes in place, clutching his stomach. Tsuru-Sen’nin telepathically tells Chiaotzu not to throw him out of the ring, but to beat the hell out of him. Kuririn curses this Chōnōryoku, and Chiaotzu kicks him into the back wall. Kuririn staggers back up and says his head isn’t a soccer ball. Then Kuririn gets an idea after noticing that Chiaotzu needs to use his hands in order to use his Chōnōryoku.
 “3 + 4!?” yells Kuririn, and Chiaotzu needs to count it out on his fingers. Kuririn is free, and he takes the opportunity to slug Chiaotzu in the gut. Chiaotzu regains his composure before Kuririn can strike again, and Tenshinhan’s relieved, while Tsuru-Sen’nin’s pissed. Chiaotzu’s going to counter that: “16 + 27!?” Kuririn knows its 43, then asks “9 – 1!?” Chiaotzu frantically tries to count it out, and Kuririn punches him out of the ring. “Ringout!!! It’s Kuririn’s win!!!” Goku’s excited, Jackie’s pleased, Tsuru-Sen’nin’s pissed, and Kuririn tells Chiaotzu the answer was 8.
"
Goku vs. Panpoot,122,"The cover of this chapter shows Pamput and Goku.
 The announcer declares the fourth match is about to begin, and with this, all eight competitors will have appeared. First Pamput is called out, and apparently he’s a pretty famous competitor. And, of course, Son Goku was the runner up at the previous tournament. The announcer thinks this’ll be an amazing match. Pamput punches at Goku, stopping just in front of his face, but Goku doesn’t even flinch. Pamput asks him about that, and Goku says the punch didn’t look that powerful. Pamput thinks Goku doesn’t realize how great he is, and asks the announcer for a moment to show him.
 Goku defeats Pamput with a single elbow to his stomach Pamput starts punching and kicking the air, then does some back flips over to the back wall. He elbows the wall, breaking off part of it. He asks Goku if he understands what he’s up against, and Goku says yep. The announcer starts to make his way out of the ring, and Pamput tells Goku it’ll only take him thirty seconds to win. The match is called to begin, and so Pamput charges at Goku. But Goku just elbows him in the stomach, and Panput falls over. The announcer says that Pamput has fainted, so it’s Goku’s win.
 The announcer goes on about it being only one hit, but Tenshinhan insists it wasn’t. Tenshinhan explains that while holding off his opponent’s agile punch with his right hand, Goku gave an elbow with his left, which was really three shots in all. Tenshinhan thinks this isn’t an ordinary brat, and that this tournament has gotten a little more interesting. Backstage, Kuririn congratulates Goku on beating that dude who was supposed to be really great. Jackie tells them that that dude was really great, they’ve just become ridiculously strong, and their eyes can see fast movements easily, etc. Kuririn brings up how Yamcha lost, and he himself had a rough time against that chibi. Jackie just says that Tsuru-Sen’nin’s group is also ridiculously strong.
 ""Well then, from this we'll carry out the semifinal fifth match!! The first match's winner, Tenshinhan, versus the second match's winner, Jackie Chun!!"" Jackie heads out to the ring where Tenshinhan is waiting. Tenshinhan thinks to himself that this old man is not ordinary. Meanwhile, Kuririn wonders just how strong they (he and Goku) have really become.
"
Tenshinhan vs. Jackie Chun,123,"The cover of this chapter shows Tien Shinhan fighting Jackie Chun.
 Jackie Chun produces several afterimages of himself The World Tournament Announcer thinks this will be an interesting match, and calls for it to begin. Krillin thinks Jackie Chun will win this one, and get revenge for Yamcha while he is at it, but Goku is not so sure. Tenshinhan punches at Jackie, but Jackie blocks it. Jackie kicks back at Tenshinhan, but Tenshinhan blocks it. Tenshinhan high kicks at Jackie, and Jackie ducks it, then grabs Tenshinhan's leg and tosses him across the ring. But Tenshinhan flips over, and kicks off the floor, charging towards Jackie with his Hammerhead. But Jackie jumps over him, then he and Tenshinhan jump back at each other, exchanging a few punches mid-air.
 Tien's third eye spots the real Jackie Chun The two of them land with their backs to each other, and then Jackie quickly runs around, surrounding Tenshinhan with a whole bunch of afterimages. Tenshinhan recognizes this as the Multiple Zanzōken. He looks around, and kicks the real Jackie Chun into the wall. He says his three eyes can not be fooled by tricks like that. Jackie decides to throw off his jacket, and Tenshinhan flies at him, asking if he can see the movements of his hands (he is flailing them). Jackie does, and grabs each arm by the wrist, then knees Tenshinhan in the gut. Jackie then kicks Tenshinhan up into the air, and Tenshinhan is pissed when he lands.
 Tenshinhan rushes at Jackie again, this time getting in a knee to the chest and a punch to the face, knocking Jackie down. Jackie kicks back up, and delivers a slobber-knocking punch to Tenshinhan's face. They break away from each other, and the onlookers are in awe as Jackie and Tenshinhan each wonder about the other.
"
Young Tenshinhan,124,"The cover of this chapter shows Tien Shinhan in a kicking pose. Jackie Chun and Master Shen can be seen behind him.
 Tien uses the solar flare Jackie Chun starts talking about Tsuru-Sen'nin, and Tenshinhan tells him he will be sorry for talking bad about his teacher and says he’ll be getting serious. “What!? Are you saying you weren’t serious up until now?” asks Jackie. Kuririn thinks it’s a bluff, as Tenshinhan holds his hands in front of his face, with the backs of his hands facing out, thumbs closed in, and the other eight fingers spread apart. Tenshinhan announces his new Tsuru-sen technique, the Taiyō-Ken, and he unleashes a flash of light that blinds everyone who isn’t wearing sunglasses.
 Tenshinhan runs over and knees Jackie in the back of the head, knocking him out. The announcer begins the count as Goku and Kuririn slowly open their eyes again. Jackie gets back up at five, surprising Tenshinhan, and Jackie asks if he couldn’t have pity on an old man whose eyes are already going bad. Tsuru-Sen’nin wonders about Jackie, and Tenshinhan asks who the hell he is. Jackie asks why a guy like him is involved with Tsuru-Sen’nin, and says he should think about choosing the light over the shadow. Tenshinhan yells out that if he keeps talking crap, he’s going to shut his mouth for him, and begins to run towards Jackie.
 Tien fires a kamehameha at Jackie Chun Tenshinhan punches at Jackie, but Jackie blocks it, then Tenshinhan gets in a kick to the face. Jackie asks him if he’s getting confused, and Tenshinhan can’t believe he’s still talking. Goku wonders how the announcer was able to call the knee strike when it was all bright before, and the announcer points out his sunglasses to Goku. Jackie continues going on about Tsuru-Sen’nin being bad, and then Tsuru-Sen’nin realizes who Jackie Chun really is. He telepathically tells Tenshinhan this old man is Kame-Sen’nin in disguise. Jackie realizes his secret’s been exposed, at least to those two.
 Jackie Chun rings himself out Tenshinhan decides he’ll show him an interesting counter, and Jackie asks if he maybe means an etchi book. Tenshinhan yells at him, and then starts his attack. “Ka… me… ha…” Kuririn, Goku, and Jackie are all shocked. “Me… Ha!!!” Tenshinhan fires a huge Kamehameha, and Jackie yells out that he’ll kill the audience. Jackie holds out his hands to catch the Kamehameha and diverts it up into the air. Tenshinhan says that’s a standard technique, and he can easily make things like that his own by watching them being performed just once.
 Jackie says some more stuff about walking the bright path, and then walks over to the edge of the ring and hops out. Everyone’s shocked as Jackie hops back in the ring to grab his jacket and go backstage. Tenshinhan asks him why as he heads back, but Jackie just hums along and ignores him. Tsuru-Sen’nin thinks he was scared, but Tenshinhan thinks otherwise. Backstage, Jackie wonders what kind of era it’ll be from now on (him letting the youngsters do this).
"
Goku vs. Kuririn,125,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku and Krillin both riding vehicles.
 Krillin uses his bald head to reflect off the sun and blind Goku It’s time for the sixth match to begin between Kame-Sen’nin’s two students, Son Goku and Kuririn, with the winner going on to the finals against Tenshinhan. Kuririn suddenly realizes the two of them will be fighting, and freaks out, but Goku’s excited about them fighting for the first time. They each promise to do their best and head out to the ring. Meanwhile, Jackie is backstage changing back into the suit and hat he wore to the arena, and Tenshinhan shows up as he puts on his sunglasses. He asks about the disguise and Kame-Sen’nin tells him it’s for the benefit of his students. Tenshinhan says he must have given up after realizing none of them can beat him.
 “Well then, please begin the second match!!” Kame-Sen’nin tells Tenshinhan that none of his students are foolish enough to think they will win every fight. Kame-Sen’nin prepares to walk off, saying Tenshinhan is the same and he will end up on the right path. Tenshinhan decides to tell him about a good thing: he aims to take Tao Pai-pai’s place as the world’s number one hitman. Kame-Sen’nin shrugs that off and leaves, wishing him a good match, and admits that if they would have continued their match, he would have lost. Tenshinhan thinks the old man has no pride, admitting that he’s weak.
 Kuririn kicks at Goku, but Goku blocks it, then Goku blocks Kuririn’s punch. Goku kicks at Kuririn, and Kuririn jumps over it, then kicks at Goku mid-air, but Goku blocks it. Kuririn lands, then Goku rushes at him and whacks him in the face. Kuririn jumps back and looks up to see that Goku's gone. Out of nowhere, Goku kicks Kuririn, then gets in a few more kicks that Kuririn just barely blocks. Then Kuririn strikes at Goku, and they break. They talk a bit before Kuririn rushes at Goku with an elbow to the face, then a kick across the ring. Kuririn rushes after Goku, but Goku jumps into the air. So, Kuririn jumps up after him, and gets a look at the sun. Kuririn tilts his shiny bald head just right, and flashes some sunlight in Goku's eyes. Then Kuririn kicks Goku down towards the ring, but Goku lands on his feet rather than crashing.
"
"Goku vs. Kuririn, Part 2",126,"The cover of this chapter shows Krillin and Goku fighting high up in the air.
 Krillin fires a kamehameha at Goku Kuririn is still coming back down and Goku decides to jump up and attack him for the win. Goku jump kicks up towards him, so Kuririn sucks in a bunch of air. Kuririn’s all puffed like a blow fish now and he floats up just over Goku’s kick. Kuririn deflates and lands safely, as Goku kicks off the backstage wall and lands as well. Goku compliments Kuririn, and says this is his first fun fight. They’re both excited, and Kame-Sen’nin is watching from the back of the audience (standing on his staff to get a good view). Goku then rushes at Kuririn, yelling out “Ka-me-ha-me…” along the way. Just as Goku gets in front of Kuririn, he jumps up into the air and yells “Ha!!!!”, but fires the Kamehameha off into the air instead of at Kuririn. It propels Goku toward Kuririn and he punches him in the face, and then knees him in the gut.
 Everyone’s shocked at Goku’s ferocity, but Kuririn eventually gets back up at the count of three. Kuririn says that wasn’t a fun attack, and gets pissed and prepares to unleash his counterattack. Kuririn rushes at Goku, but Goku easily pops him on the back. When Kuririn gets back up, he runs across the ring and thinks a bit. Then he prepares to unleash a Kamehameha, and Goku tries to tell him that won’t work against him. Goku simply holds out his hand and the blast explodes on his hand. “See! Useless, don’t you think?” But Kuririn’s gone, and he suddenly appears behind Goku. Kuririn grabs his tail, calling out how it’s his weak point. Tenshinhan wonders about this weak point business and Kame-Sen’nin’s impressed with Kuririn’s strategy.
"
"Goku vs. Kuririn, Part 3",127,"The cover of this chapter shows Master Roshi driving a car. Krillin is in the passenger seat and Goku is hanging from the roof. The cars door reads ""Capsule 627"".
 Krillin lands out of bounds and loses the match Kuririn laughs about this turnabout as Goku slowly loses his strength. “Whoooooa, contestant Son is down!! What in the world could be wrong!?” Tenshinhan thinks this is rather unexpected, and laughs about how fighting that Kuririn guy will be an easy victory for him. Goku suddenly gets up just as the count reaches nine and jumps over Kuririn’s head while he’s still holding his tail. Then Goku slams Kuririn down using his tail, and explains that he trained his tail just like Kame-Sen’nin had suggested. (Except that it was his dead Grandpa who said it, not Kame-Sen’nin.) Kame-Sen’nin ponders this turn of events, and says that Goku now has no weak point.
 Goku surprises Krillin Kuririn does the old “look over there” gag, and elbows Goku in the face when his head is turned. Kame-Sen’nin says he does have a weak point after all — he’s too docile and honest. Goku then vanishes from sight. Kuririn frantically looks around, but he can’t find Goku, nor can anyone else; except Tenshinhan, who thinks to himself that he hasn’t disappeared, they just can’t see him because he’s going ridiculously fast. Goku suddenly appears in front of Kuririn sticking his tongue out, freaking Kuririn out, and then Goku whacks Kuririn, tossing him out of the ring. “Ring out… I-it’s contestant Son’s win…”
 Everyone’s surprised by the turn of events, except Tenshinhan. Tsuru-Sen’nin and Kame-Sen’nin each wonder about Goku as well. The announcer asks Goku if he’d like to have a recess before the finals, but Goku declines. “Now, ladies and gentleman, at last the greatest martial artist in the world will be decided!! It’s the finals!!! As expected, the honor of the greatest in the world and a five hundred thousand zenny prize will be waiting for either Tenshinhan, or perhaps Son Goku. Surely this will be the can’t-miss match of the century!!!” Kuririn tells Goku not to lose, and Tenshinhan thinks this should be fun.
"
Goku vs. Tenshinhan,128,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku and Tien Shinhan both in fighting poses.
 The announcer goes on about how the Twenty-Second Tenka’ichi Budōkai has gone from a hundred eighty-two participants down to just two — Tenshinhan and Son Goku. Kame-Sen’nin wants a closer look, so he runs through the audience and heads over behind the back wall next to the ring where Kuririn is watching. Kuririn tells him only contestants are supposed to be back here, but Kame-Sen’nin’s unconcerned. Tsuru-Sen’nin and Chiaotzu watch in the audience, with Tsuru-Sen’nin thinking of how Tenshinhan can’t lose to Kame-Sen’nin’s student, for Tao Pai-pai’s sake.
 Goku is struck by Tien's Dodonpa Tenshinhan and Goku stare each other down, and the announcer calls for the match to begin. Goku flies at Tenshinhan and strikes at him, but Tenshinhan blocks it. Then Tenshinhan kicks at Goku, and Goku jumps over it, grabbing onto Tenshinhan’s leg with his tail. Goku swings around Tenshinhan’s leg, and comes up and uppercuts Tenshinhan, knocking him across the ring. Tenshinhan flips over before he crashes, and kicks off the ring, heading up into the air. Goku goes up after him with a jump kick, but Tenshinhan fires a Dodonpa down at Goku. It’s a direct hit, and Goku crashes down through the ring, busting up some tiles.
 Tenshinhan smirks and comes back down to the ring, and then Goku shoots up from under the ring. Goku suddenly kicks off the ring when he lands, and rushes at Tenshinhan. Goku does the same super-speed trick he used against Kuririn where he appears to have vanished, but Tenshinhan pays attention to the sounds of Goku’s movements and whacks Goku hard, knocking him across the ring. “Do you think a child’s trick like that would work against me?!!” Tenshinhan charges after Goku, elbowing him into the back wall, and then Tenshinhan repeatedly strikes at Goku up against the wall. Kame-Sen’nin says that attack’s like a machine gun, and then Tenshinhan clubs Goku down off the wall. Tenshinhan holds the faint Goku up with one hand, and asks him if he’d like to go to Heaven or Hell.
"
The Volleyball Play,129,"The cover of this chapter shows Tien Shinhan and Goku ready to fight. Spectators such as Turtle, Oolong, Krillin, Master Roshi and Master Shen are seen watching.
 Now Tenshinhan’s going to finish Goku off. He tosses Goku up into the air, and then Tenshinhan does an about-face and calls out, “Haikyū-Ken, here I go!!!” Tenshinhan makes a really cute face, then slaps his hands together and rushes toward Goku, just before he falls back to the ring. “One!!” Tenshinhan bumps Goku back into the air with the back of his wrist. “Two!!” Tenshinhan holds his hands up over his head, setting Goku like a volleyball in the air. Tenshinhan then jumps up after Goku. “Attaaaaaack!!!!” Tenshinhan spikes Goku back down toward the ring, and Goku hits it hard, looking dead.
 But Goku easily kicks back up, shocking everyone. Tenshinhan tells him he’s surprisingly tough, and Goku says he should start going all out. Tenshinhan laughs, and asks about that. Goku explains he only used his “Match Use Power”. “However, since it seems you want to kill me, I’m going to use my Battle Use Power!!” Tenshinhan wonders about this, then shrugs it off and calls Goku to bring it on. Goku rushes at Tenshinhan, then punches him in the face, socks him in the gut, and then kicks Tenshinhan across the ring. Goku then charges after Tenshinhan, flying under him. He kicks Tenshinhan in the back from below, sending Tenshinhan way up into the air.
 Goku decides to fire a Kamehameha up at Tenshinhan, but stops just before the last “ha”. Tenshinhan then lands, taking a moment to regain his composure. He tells Goku how great this feels, since he’s never had a fight like this before. Kuririn thinks Goku’s stupid for stopping the Kamehameha, but Kame-Sen’nin explains to him that it would’ve been a waste of energy to use it now, as Goku blocks an elbow from Tenshinhan.
"
The Fist of the Sun,130,"The cover shows Master Roshi in a van, yellow in color, with his three students (Yamcha, Goku, and Krillin). The cover art for this chapter is also featured in the Akira Toriyama - The World artbooks and Daizenshuu 1.
 Goku and Tenshinhan repeatedly strike at each other in fast flurries, which the announcer says is too fast for them (the spectators) to see. Tenshinhan kicks at Goku, but Goku backflips out of the way, and then surrounds Tenshinhan with multiple afterimages. Tenshinhan can’t believe he’d actually use a Zanzōken at a time like this, as a Goku comes down from above toward Tenshinhan. Tenshinhan kicks at the Goku, while another Goku comes at Tenshinhan from behind. This Goku punches right through Tenshinhan, while the real Tenshinhan shows up behind this Goku and chops down at him. Tenshinhan punches right through this Goku, and, finally, the real Goku delivers a very hard kick to the face.
 Kame-Sen’nin and Kuririn, along with Tsuru-Sen’nin and Chiaotzu, are all shocked at this, as Tenshinhan slowly makes his way back up. Tenshinhan’s pissed, and so he prepares to counter this. “Taiyō-Ken!!!” There’s a huge flash of light again, and Tenshinhan rushes over toward Goku to attack him now that he’s blinded. But Goku catches his fist with his left hand, and then punches Tenshinhan in the stomach with his right. Tenshinhan weakly asks how, and he looks up to see Goku wearing Kame-Sen’nin’s sunglasses.
 Tenshinhan is down, and Goku takes the opportunity to walk over to give Kame-Sen’nin back his sunglasses. But, Tenshinhan suddenly gets back up at seven, and knees Goku in the face up against the wall. Goku hops back behind Tenshinhan; his face really hurts now. Tenshinhan insists he was only down because he was unprepared, as Kame-Sen’nin cries about his sunglasses getting broken. At that, Goku decides he’ll make him go down for real this time.
 Kuririn thinks Kame-Sen’nin seems familiar without the shades, and Kame-Sen’nin yells at him to not worry about that at a time like this. Goku and Tenshinhan rush at each other and Goku jumps up and prepares to attack Tenshinhan from above. But then Goku suddenly freezes in place, and Tenshinhan strikes him hard, knocking him back down to the ring. Kame-Sen’nin’s surprised at that, as Goku slowly sits up and says, “Th… That’s dirty…!!” Tenshinhan wonders what he means as Tsuru-Sen’nin laughs to himself.
"
Tsuru-Sen'nin,131,"The cover of this chapter shows scenes of Goku's and Tien Shinhan's fight, and Krillin and Jackie Chun talking.
 Goku goes on about this being dirty, but Tenshinhan doesn’t know what he’s talking about. Kame-Sen’nin curses Tsuru-Sen’nin, as Tenshinhan rushes at Goku. Goku dares him to try that again, and he rushes at Tenshinhan in turn. “Do it, Chiaotzu!” says Tsuru-Sen’nin, and Chiaotzu points his finger out at Goku. Goku freezes in place again, and Tenshinhan delivers a hard kick to the face, sending Goku bouncing across the ring. Goku bounces over the edge, while upside down, and so he fires a Kamehameha at the ground to propel himself back into the ring.
 Goku kicks off the ground once he lands, and charges at Tenshinhan, and Tenshinhan charges toward Goku as well. “Do it!” Chiaotzu freezes Goku again, giving Tenshinhan another chance to smack Goku down. The announcer bellows, “Whoa, suddenly the tide has turned for contestant Son. He’s finally down!!” Goku can’t get back up, seemingly because of Chiaotzu’s telekinesis. This time, it seems Tenshinhan’s noticed something, and he wonders, “C-could it be…” Tsuru-Sen’nin telepathically orders Tenshinhan to kill him, and Tenshinhan realizes that’s what it is.
 Tenshinhan telepathically asks Chiaotzu if this is his doing, then telepathically yells at him to undo it. Tenshinhan doesn’t want to win like this. Chiaotzu asks his teacher what to do, and Tsuru-Sen’nin telepathically orders Tenshinhan to stop being stupid and kill him. After the count of eight, Tenshinhan suddenly yells (aloud) to stop, and Chiaotzu relents, as everyone else wonders what just happened. Goku quickly gets back up, angry, and he charges at Tenshinhan, but Kame-Sen’nin yells at him to hold it.
 Tsuru-Sen’nin is indignant at Tenshinhan for his disobedience, and Tenshinhan explains to him how he just wants to win the match by fighting all on his own, using his own true strength. Tsuru-Sen’nin angrily repeats his command. “…I can’t kill him… If I kill him, I won’t win the match… B-besides, I… don’t really want to become a hitman anymore…” Tsuru-Sen’nin thinks he’s been listening to Kame-Sen’nin’s claptrap, and yells at Chiaotzu to resume, but Chiaotzu is reluctant. “T… Ten-san is fighting all on his own for the first time… I… I also want to see the match to the end…”
 Tsuru-Sen’nin is seeing red now, and grabs Chiaotzu and asks who he wants to die, “you or him?” Kame-Sen’nin yells at Tenshinhan to move aside, and he fires a Kamehameha at Tsuru-Sen’nin, blasting him off into the distance. Kame-Sen’nin yells that they can both do as they like with him out of the way. But Tenshinhan feels conflicted for having completely betrayed his teacher, and resolves not to lose this match. Tenshinhan then yells out at Goku to prepare for this next great attack. Chiaotzu cries out at him from the audience, asking Ten-san if he plans to do “that”, as Goku readies himself.
"
The Arms Race,132,"The cover of this chapter is Tien Shinhan standing. In the background, there is a gray picture of Tien's teacher, Master Shen.
 Tien produces two extra arms Goku goes on about this being dirty, but Tenshinhan does not know what he’s talking about. Kame-Sen’nin curses Tsuru-Sen’nin, as Tenshinhan rushes at Goku. Goku dares him to try that again, and he rushes at Tenshinhan in turn. “Do it, Chiaotzu!” says Tsuru-Sen’nin, and Chiaotzu points his finger out at Goku. Goku freezes in place again, and Tenshinhan delivers a hard kick to the face, sending Goku bouncing across the ring.

 Goku uses super speed to create an illusion that he has eight arms Tenshinhan telepathically asks Chiaotzu if this is his doing, then telepathically yells at him to undo it. Tenshinhan doesn’t want to win like this. Chiaotzu asks his teacher what to do, and Tsuru-Sen’nin telepathically orders Tenshinhan to stop being stupid and kill him.

"
Desperation Move,133,"The cover of this chapter shows scenes of Goku's and Tien Shinhan's fight.
 Tien fires his tri-beam at Goku Tenshinhan keeps shouting down at Goku to avoid this, but Goku is unmoving. Master Roshi continues objecting, while Chiaotzu pleads to Ten-san not to die. Tenshinhan looks down at Goku and says ""Here goes!!"", and Goku stands ready to take it. Tenshinhan folds his hands in front of himself with the index fingers up, and starts powering up. Then, he pulls his hands apart, and they start charging up. Krillin asks about his hands glowing, so Kame-Sen’nin explains that Tenshinhan is focusing all the ki in his body.
 Tenshinhan puts his hands together in a triangle form. ""The target… is the ring!!"", Tenshinhan thinks he will completely use up all of his ki and deplete his strength, and then ""Tri-Beam!!!!"" There is a huge flash and explosion. Tenshinhan pants as he looks down at the ring, just as Kuririn and Kame-Sen’nin notice the damage. The announcer is shocked as well. ""T-the ring is… gone!!!! W-what in the world is this, h-how… T-the ring was just here a moment before. I-it's completely disintegrated…!!!!"" There is just a huge hole in the ground where the ring was. Where Goku was…
 The effect of Tien's tri-beam Goku fires a kamehameha to propel himself towards Tien Kame-Sen’nin is impressed with the Kikōhō, but Kuririn is more worried about Goku having been disintegrated as well. Kame-Sen’nin doubts he is dead, and then Tenshinhan notices something and flies up. It is Goku! Tenshinhan is impressed with Goku for having jumped all the way up here just in the nick of time. Goku compliments his technique, saying he would have died if he had not gotten out of the way. The World Tournament Announcer looks up at the two of them with some binoculars, continuing to call the match.
 Gravity is getting the better of Goku, and with there being no more ring, or earth where the ring was, simply touching the ground would constitute a ring-out now. Therefore, the first one to fall loses. Tenshinhan talks about how he can freely fly with Flight, so the outcome is pretty obvious. But Goku says he is going to try one last attack with all of his remaining strength. Tenshinhan thinks Goku is wasting his time, but Goku says Tenshinhan should be worn out from his attack. Goku starts up a Kamehameha, and Tenshinhan just laughs about this. But then Goku does an about face, firing off a pretty big Kamehameha, so that it propels him toward a worried Tenshinhan.

Up in the Air,134,"The cover of this chapter shows Tien Shinhan, Bulma, Chiaotzu, Krillin, Goku, Master Roshi, Puar, Yamcha, Launch, Turtle and Oolong. This cover art is also featured in Daizenshuu 1.
 Goku headbutts Tien Goku continues flying straight at Tenshinhan, and hits him with a hard headbutt to the gut. So, now Tenshinhan is falling at an angle off into the city, away from the arena. Although, Goku is falling at the same angle a bit behind Tenshinhan, since the Kamehameha used up so much of his strength, he can’t really move his body. The announcer throws out a capsule and out pops a cute little shark-decorated vehicle. He hops on, and then zooms off to go continue calling the match.
 Goku and Tenshinhan are much closer to the ground now, and so Goku manages to fire off a little Kamehameha to slightly increase his altitude. The announcer calls this, and, on a radio in the hospital, Yamcha, Pu’er, Bulma, and Lunch hear it and get excited. Kuririn’s relieved back at the arena as well. But, suddenly… A truck drives down the street, right in Goku’s path, and Goku hits the truck, bouncing off and crashing into the street. Tenshinhan crashes just afterwards. “Contestant Tenshinhan has won!! He’s won!! Contestant Tenshinhan- is determined the greatest in the world!!” Chiaotzu is happy to hear this, while everyone else is shocked.
 Goku hits a truck and lands on the floor before Tien Some time passes after the finish and the announcers bids all fans farewell. “Well then, let’s all meet up again after three years. Goodbye!!” The whole gang is together now, along with Tenshinhan and Chiaotzu. Goku changes into Kuririn’s less tattered dōgi, since he has nothing else to change into, unlike everyone else. Tenshinhan offers Goku half the prize money, but Goku declines (he wouldn’t know what to do with money). Tenshinhan insists he only won by luck, and is feeling a bit humbled.
 Like last time, Kame-Sen’nin suggests they all go out to eat. Tenshinhan thinks he could at least pay with his prize money, and Kuririn tells him he’ll regret that (because of Goku’s unbelievable appetite). “Ah, we can’t go!! Where’s Grandpa’s Dragon Ball and my Nyoi-Bō?!” Kuririn offers to go to the backstage house thing and get them for Goku, as Yamcha (on crutches because of his leg) and Tenshinhan somewhat make up. Kame-Sen’nin offers to let the two of them come train at his place, and Lunch highly agrees (she says she’s fallen in love with Tenshinhan because he’s so wild). But Tenshinhan declines, since they’re still Tsuru-Sen’nin’s students despite it all. He and Chiaotzu will go live somewhere.
 Krillin is murdered Suddenly, there’s a loud scream from inside the backstage house, and Goku recognizes it as Kuririn’s voice. Everyone runs in, and Kuririn is down, as is the announcer. Kuririn is out, but the announcer is still awake. The announcer weakly says a monster came in and took a weird ball and the Budōkai name registration list. Kame-Sen’nin wonders about that, when Goku shouts that Kuririn is dead. Someone killed him!
"
The Death of Kuririn,135,"The cover of this chapter shows Krillin, Goku and Master Roshi in individual rectangles, while a large image of King Piccolo is behind them.
 The Evil Containment Wave being used on King Piccolo Master Roshi warns Goku to keep calm, but the death of Krillin enrages Goku, who flies off on the Flying Nimbus in search of Krillin's assassin. Oolong finds a slip of paper with King Piccolo's insignia on it, which Master Roshi recognizes. Master Roshi then explains who King Piccolo is, and tells the others about how Master Mutaito found a technique, which sealed King Piccolo away in an Electric Rice Cooker at the cost of his own life. Master Roshi afterwards threw the Electric Rice Cooker into the sea.
 Demon King Piccolo and his son Piano While Roshi wonders why the assassin took the Dragon Ball and the World Martial Arts Tournament contestant list, King Piccolo is shown on Pilaf's Flying Base. It is revealed that he plans to gather the Dragon Balls in order to wish for youth and that he also decided to have all finalists of the World Martial Arts Tournament killed so that no one can learn the Evil Containment Wave and imprison him once more.
 Meanwhile, Goku catches up to Tambourine, Krillin's killer.
"
Target: Tenka'ichi Budokai,136,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku standing on the Flying Nimbus looking angrily at Tambourine. An image of King Piccolo is towering over them.
 Goku spots Tambourine The monster, a winged, half-clothed creature, spots Goku approaching. He’s holding the name registration list in one hand, and when Goku spots the Four-Star Ball in the other, he becomes enraged. “Give me back my Dragon Ball and Kuririn’s life!!!!” The demon thinks this Kuririn must be the brat who defied him, and laughs about how easily he died. “You’re Kuririn’s enemy…! I’m gonna attack and kill you!!”
 The demon isn’t worried, and asks what kind of return attack he has. Goku swipes at him, but the demon jumps over it, then kicks Goku off of Kinto-Un. But Kinto-Un quickly whooshes down and catches him, and Goku’s angry about having used up all of his strength at the Budōkai. Goku yells at the demon that if his belly was full… But the demon says his mouth is plenty full, and decides to shut it permanently. The demon fires a blast from his mouth, missing Goku, but blowing up Kinto-Un. Then he hits Goku down toward the ground, and Goku crashes into a little jungle below.
 Tambourine destroys Goku's Flying Nimbus It’s night outside now, and back at the Budōkai, everyone is still waiting for Goku. Yamcha’s annoyed, and he says that they’re sure to be targeted next. Oolong isn’t worried, since he’s uninvolved, but Bulma yells at him that it’ll be bad for everyone if Piccolo takes over the world. Tenshinhan asks about the Mafūba, but Kame-Sen’nin dismisses the idea. The announcer figures it wouldn’t do any good to call the police, and Kame-Sen’nin tells him it’d just cause a panic. Then Kame-Sen’nin asks the announcer to tell Goku they’ve gone home if he should return. Tenshinhan and Chiaotzu are welcome to come as well. Oolong is worried about his future, and Lunch yells at him that it ain’t just about him.
 Tambourine gives King Piccolo the Dragon Ball It’s daylight again, I guess the next day now. Up in the airship, the demon hands the Four-Star Ball over to Piccolo. Then he gives him the Budōkai name registration list, which tells the names of the participants over the past ten years. The Dragon Ball was also on the Budōkai grounds, so it was “two birds with one stone”. Piccolo tells him to put them up on the wall (there’s a poster for each person, photo, address, and statistics), and Pilaf’s gang volunteers to help.
 Namu, Ran-Fan, and then the demon gets to the Kuririn poster, and says there’s no need to put up this one, he’s already dead. Mai points out a certain page to Pilaf, and they freak out, because it’s you-know-who. He’s participated twice, and was the runner up both times. The demon says there’s no need to put that one up either, because he killed him, too. Pilaf’s gang can’t believe it, but the demon insists he’s dead. The demon says if a person like that was runner up, then the martial artists in the world now must not be much. Still, Piccolo doesn’t want to be careless. Pilaf hadn’t realized this person they freed was so powerful, as Goku lies face down on the jungle floor.
"
"We Need You, Goku!",137,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku in a fighting position, with King Piccolo sitting behind him.
 Demon King Piccolo spits out an egg Piccolo thinks of his restored youth, and then calls on the demon, addressing him as Tambourine. He tells Tambourine to go obliterate the expert martial artists, and the pterodactyl-looking guy asks who’ll gather the Dragon Balls. Piccolo says he’ll increase the number of warriors, and Pilaf thinks he’ll lose his lunch if he does that again. The pterodactyl-looking guy advises against producing an egg again in his state, but Piccolo insists it’ll be alright, his youth will soon be restored by the Dragon Balls. So, Piccolo tries to think of a name for a Dragon-Type warrior to gather the Dragon Balls. Then, Piccolo starts some chanting, and he… coughs up a huge egg.
 Piccolo tells this one his name is Cymbal, and tells him to wake up. A fat dragon pops out, with wings just like Tambourine, and Piccolo tells Cymbal he needs to gather the six remaining Dragon Balls. Piccolo asks Pilaf where the next Dragon Ball is, so Pilaf points it out on the giant radar globe. Cymbal notes the spot on the globe, as Tambourine decides on his next kill — Namu. Then both Cymbal and Tambourine fly off. Shuu is worried that they won’t be able to trust Piccolo Daimaō, but Pilaf assures him, and Mai, that he’ll be getting half the world.
 Cymbal hatches from the egg At Kame House, the concept of the Dragon Balls has apparently been explained to Tenshinhan and Chiaotzu. Bulma says the wish they need to make is to return Kuririn to life. Yamcha thinks about how it’ll be bad if Piccolo makes a wish instead, with Pu’er saying how they can’t revive Kuririn for a year’s time. Oolong brings up that if they brought Kuririn back after that long, he’d just be a zombie. Which is why Bulma is going to make a refrigeration capsule. She asks Oolong if he wants to get in one, too, and Oolong just says he’s alive.
 The TV news reports that Nam was killed by one of Demon King Piccolo's monsters Kame-Sen’nin starts mumbling to himself. “Hmm… Light gray…” Yamcha asks him what sort of plan that’s supposed to be. “No, Bulma’s panties.” (Bulma’s wearing a skirt and sitting on the couch in a position that could reveal such a thing.) Bulma gets pissed and yells at Kame-Sen’nin, then beats him up. Then Lunch points out something on the TV: a news report about the death of Namu. There was a “demon” paper left behind again. So, they all realize the other participants are in danger as well, not just them. Tenshinhan’s pissed that there’ll be a worldwide panic.
 Kame-Sen’nin asks Bulma how long it’ll take to make a new radar, and she says hurrying, it’ll take half a day. So, everyone flies off in a plane, apparently without Bulma. Meanwhile, off in the jungle, Goku slowly wakes up! He smells some food, and quickly runs over to find a huge fish roasting over a fire.
"
The Weirdo with the Ball,138,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku and Yajirobe facing each other. Yajirobe has a Dragon Ball hanging from his neck.
 Goku thinks this awesome fish looks like a dream. He jumps up on it and starts eating it, until only the skeleton is left, and his belly is inflated like a balloon. He’s feeling good now, and he runs over and punches a huge rock, putting a big hole in it. He’s full of strength now, ready to go get that monster again, and he calls for Kinto-Un. But Kinto-Un doesn’t come, so it must really be destroyed this time. Goku is really angry again, because now it’s killed two of his friends.
 Yajirobe appears Goku pulls out the Dragon Radar, and it says there is a Dragon Ball right around here. Goku thinks that guy must be somewhere around here, just as a big boulder comes flying at Goku. But Goku jumps over it, then jumps up on top of the boulder, and tells the “monster” to come out. A fat guy with shaggy hair, a sword, and the One-Star Ball hanging from his neck comes out, asking what he means by this “monster” business. The man is annoyed about him eating his fish, and Goku hadn’t realized it belonged to someone, thinking it just dropped down here. The guy says he’s an idiot for thinking a roasted fish would just drop down, and Goku hops down off the boulder.
 Yajirobe and Goku battle Goku notices the man has a Dragon Ball around his neck, although he’s not close enough to notice it only has one star, and thinks it’s his Dragon Ball. He thinks this guy must be in cahoots with that monster, so Goku asks him where the guy with the wings is. The guy insists he’s not telling the fish thief anything. The two exchange insults, and then they charge toward each other. Goku blocks the man’s punches, until he headbutts Goku and knocks him down. But then Goku jumps up and headbutts the man back, and he reels a bit.
 The guy kicks at Goku, but Goku sidesteps it and punches him in the face. Then Goku kicks him, and he crashes into a nearby mountain. He gets up and dusts himself off, then they stare each other down, wondering about the other. Goku finally notices the Dragon Ball the guy has isn’t his Grandpa’s, and asks about it. The guy says he picked this up three years ago, and Goku apologizes for his mistake. The guy is still annoyed about his fish, though, since it was his breakfast. Then Goku spots something flying their way, and thinks it’s that monster again. But actually, it’s Cymbal, not Tambourine. Cymbal asks if they happen to know where a tiny ball with stars on it is.
"
Yajirobe's Prey,139,"The cover of this chapter shows Yajirobe with the Dragon Ball hanging around his neck, and holding up a knife and fork. Behind him are Cymbal and Goku.
 Cymbal fires his beam ray at Yajirobe Goku has realized this is not the monster from before, and Cymbal notices the other guy has the Dragon Ball for this area. Cymbal tells him to hand it over, and so Goku thinks this monster must be on the same side as the other one. The guy doesn’t want to, and so Cymbal decides he’ll have to take it from his corpse. Goku insists that he gets to beat up this monster, but the guy won’t let him. Goku explains about his friend getting killed by this monster’s ally, but the guy says this monster’s going to be his spoils. So, they have to Rock-Paper-Scissors for it. And the fat guy wins.
 Cymbal is bifurcated by Yajirobe He rushes at Cymbal, and punches at him, but Cymbal jumps over it and whacks the guy in the face with his tail. Then Cymbal punches the guy, sending him flying and knocking him down. Cymbal thinks he’s won, but the guy easily gets back up, saying this has been a weird day. The guy intends to eat this monster, and he jumps up and kicks Cymbal in the face. Angered, Cymbal holds out his hand and shoots off some electricity.
 The guy is really annoyed about this strange lightning. So, he rushes at Cymbal again, pulls out his sword, and cuts Cymbal in half. Piccolo feels Cymbal’s death up in the airship. The guy is roasting Cymbal’s corpse over the fire, and then he decides to taste it. Yummy! Once he’s finished eating, Goku asks the guy his name, but he wants to know his first. “I’m Goku. Son Goku.” The guy says he’s Yajirobe, a monk.

The Martial Artist Hunters,140,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku and Yajirobe riding a motorcycle.
 Tambourine kills Giran Piccolo is very pissed, and decides he’ll call on Tambourine to kill the person who killed Cymbal. Tambourine just happens to be busy kicking Giran’s ass right now, outside a little cave in a mountainous area. Two pandas are watching from the window in their house, and can’t believe this guy can beat up Giran. Giran tells Tambourine he doesn’t know who he’s messing with, and threatens Tambourine with his next attack: Guru-Guru Gum! Giran spits out the sticky stuff, tying up Tambourine. Giran asks how he likes that. “How is it, you ask?” Tambourine easily breaks through the stuff, and Giran can’t believe it.
 Now Tambourine is going to get back to work, and he flies over and puts his arm through Giran’s stomach, killing him. Then he licks the blood off of his hands, and tears up the Giran poster. That’s six down, and the next poster he has is… Yamcha! Tambourine flies off to get him, when Piccolo contacts him telepathically. Tambourine tells him how he’s already done in six, but Piccolo doesn’t care about that. Piccolo explains to Tambourine that Cymbal is dead, so he needs to go to point WSC-2933 to get his killer. Pilaf thinks Piccolo’s weird for talking to himself like this, but Mai explains that it’s telepathy. So, Tambourine changes directions, toward Goku and Yajirobe.
 Yajirobe says that still wasn’t enough, and Goku tells Yajirobe those guys are sure to come back for his Dragon Ball. Yajirobe tells him he’s supposed to say to “Yajirobe”. Goku says his voice sounds a lot like his killed friend Kuririn’s, and Yajirobe yells at him that he just said not to say his name that way. But then Yajirobe thinks this “Kuri-Whatever” dude must be pretty cool to have a voice like him, and asks if they look alike, too. Goku says Kuririn didn’t have a nose or hair, and Yajirobe thinks he must be some kind of freak.
 Goku tells Yajirobe that he must have that Dragon Ball so he can return Kuririn to life, and Yajirobe wants to know just what this ball does. But then they spot Tambourine up in the sky before Goku can explain, and Yajirobe’s excited at the thought of eating again. Goku says it’s unmistakable this time, he’s the one who killed Kuririn and Kinto-Un. Goku calls Tambourine down, and Tambourine recognizes the pissed off Goku.
"
Goku vs. Tambourine,141,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku in a position ready to fight, with Tambourine standing behind him.
 Goku fires a kamehameha at Tambourine Tambourine can’t believe he’s still alive. “Kuririn’s enemy!! Kinto-Un’s enemy!! On top of that, you stole my Dragon Ball!! I absolutely ain’t gonna forgive you!!” Yajirobe tells Son to let him eat this monster if he defeats it. Tambourine can’t believe Cymbal was defeated by this clumsy “shit brat”, and thinks he must want to die if he wants to fight him again. Goku says it is different this time; his belly’s all filled up. Tambourine wants to see just how different he is. Goku thinks of Kuririn, and Tambourine yells at him to come on, asking if he’s just talking crap again.
 Demon King Piccolo senses Tambourine's death Goku charges toward Tambourine and then surrounds him with a bunch of afterimages. Goku elbows the confused Tambourine in the face and then starts pounding on Tambourine, and finally, he punches Tambourine off. Goku rushes after him, jumps up, kicks off a rock, and comes down, kneeing Tambourine face first into the ground. Goku stands over him holding the peace sign, but then Tambourine gets back up, pissed. He can’t believe that they, the Demon Clan, would lose to a mere human, then fires off a mouth blast at Goku.
 The spot where Goku was standing is empty, and Tambourine starts to celebrate. But Goku’s just behind him and is going to get him on behalf of Kuririn and Kinto-Un. Tambourine flies off scared, so Goku grabs the Nyoi-Bō and extends it really high, taking Goku high up into the air. Then Goku jumps off and fires a Kamehameha when he gets near enough to Tambourine. Up in the airship, Piccolo feels that Tambourine has also died. Piccolo decides he’ll have to go down and take care of things personally, while Yajirobe chews out Goku for not leaving any of that monster behind for him to eat.
"
Piccolo Descends!,142,"The cover of this chapter shows the old King Piccolo holding up his hand.
 On Pilaf's Flying Base, Piccolo is enraged to discover that two of his warriors have been dispatched, and vows to show their killer his wrath. Emperor Pilaf interrupts his fury by expressing confusion at something. Piccolo asks if there is a problem, to which Pilaf responds that a Dragon Ball that was previously showing up in a certain spot on their radar is gone. Pilaf searches the radar and discovers that four of the icons that signified Dragon Balls had merged and were moving toward the next ball. Piccolo concludes that someone else is gathering the Dragon Balls and Pilaf is flustered.
 Meanwhile, in a Capsule Corporation aircraft, Tien Shinhan and Master Roshi discuss their ease in gathering four Dragon Balls because of King Piccolo's lack of speed due to his focus on eradicating martial artists. Tien muses that perhaps the one they are currently pursuing is the one Tambourine stole from Krillin, and Master Roshi acknowledges that they may soon have to face the demon himself. He then asserts that they must not engage Piccolo directly, but instead distract him and summon Shenron so they can wish for Piccolo's death. Tien complains that such a plan is too passive, but Master Roshi says that even as a group, they cannot defeat Piccolo, and that they will revive those who died at Piccolo's hand after a year. Tien bemoans the fact that they do not know the Evil Containment Wave. Roshi protests the thought, saying that if they try and fail, only Yamcha will be left to face Piccolo. Tien takes note of Master Roshi's phrasing, confirming a hypothesis he had been harboring that Master Roshi does, in fact, know the Evil Containment Wave.
 Back at Pilaf's ship, Pilaf asks Piccolo what they should do, but Piccolo is unconcerned, saying that whoever is gathering the Dragon Balls cannot collect all of them, as he himself has one. He continues, stating that allowing them to find all of the Dragon Balls will save him the trouble of tracking them down himself when he can merely take it from their dead bodies. He then declares that it is time to punish Tambourine and Cymbal's killers.
 At Yajirobe's Prairie, Yajirobe tells Goku to bring more Mutated Namekians for him to eat in exchange for his Dragon Ball. Goku, ignoring this, checks the Dragon Radar and discovers that another Dragon Ball is nearby. The pair look up and see Pilaf's ship. A voice from the ship announces its arrival to King Piccolo. Inside the ship, Shu tells Mai that she was using the outside speakers, and she then announces the arrival properly to Piccolo. Hearing this announcement, Goku concludes that Piccolo must be the leader of the monsters tracking the Dragon Balls. Yajirobe, recognizing the name, hastily hands Goku the Dragon Ball and runs away despite Goku pointing out that he said he was still hungry. Goku brushes it off and prepares for combat. Pilaf, Piano, and Piccolo look down from the ship (not landing, at Piccolo's behest) and spot Goku. Pilaf recognizes him and informs Piccolo of Goku's strength and continual thwarting of his plans. Piccolo then leaps down from the ship.
 Demon King Piccolo and Goku face off Goku asks Piccolo if he is the boss of the people who killed Krillin and stole his Dragon Ball. Yajirobe, observing from behind a tree, remarks that it really is Piccolo. Piccolo says to Goku that it appears he has combat experience. Goku declares that he will beat Piccolo too. Piccolo laughs at the fact that Goku does not know who he is, and says that he wants to kill Goku. An angry Goku insults Piccolo and leaps at him.
"
Goku vs. The Demon King,143,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku facing King Piccolo. The Power Pole can be seen on Goku's back.
 Demon King Piccolo punches Goku into the ground Goku jumps up and punches Piccolo in the face, surprising Piccolo with his speed, and knocking Piccolo back a bit. Goku kicks off the ground and comes at Piccolo again, but Piccolo holds his hand out to block him. So, Goku stops and grabs onto Piccolo’s arm with his tail, then swings up to punch Piccolo in the face. But Piccolo catches Goku with the other arm, and knocks him into the ground. Goku just touches the ground with his hands, and pushes himself back toward Piccolo, kicking Piccolo in the chest and sending him flying.
 Pilaf looks down from the airship, and tells Mai and Shuu they should run away. The pterodactyl-looking guy tells them to not freak out and have a little more faith in Daimaō. Piccolo is going to get serious now, and he removes his cloak. Piccolo says he’s going to show him just how fierce he really is, but Goku’s not worried. Piccolo then quickly charges at Goku, and he kicks Goku high up into the air. Piccolo follows Goku up there, and punches Goku straight down into the ground, or rather, through the ground.
 Goku fires a kamehameha at King Piccolo Piccolo comes down and pulls Goku up out of the hole, and holds him up with one hand, then punches him in the face with the other. Goku’s really busted up, but he still manages to bite down on Piccolo’s finger, so Piccolo tosses him to the ground. But Goku staggers back up, amazed at this guy’s strength. Piccolo tells Goku there’s nothing left for him but death, while he still has half of his power left.
 Piccolo laughs, asking what he’ll do now, and so Goku puts his hands together in Kamehameha formation. Piccolo freaks out, but once Goku starts calling out the attack, Piccolo is relieved it’s not the Mafūba. Goku fires it off, and it’s a direct hit. But… When the smoke clears, Piccolo is completely unharmed. Goku is worried, while Piccolo laughs and asks if he’d like to die slowly.
"
Goku... Loses?,144,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku with a Dragon Ball around his neck in the foreground, and King Piccolo behind him.
 King Piccolo's Makosen Goku jumps up and punches Piccolo in the face, surprising Piccolo with his speed, and knocking Goku can’t believe his strength, as Yajirobe says he’s glad he’s hiding. Then, Piccolo closes his fists, with the palms facing himself, and starts charging up for something. He looks at Goku, then throws an arm out, with the hand open and palm facing Goku, and fires a ki blast directly at him. Goku just barely manages to jump over it, but then Piccolo fires another one up at the now mid-air Goku. It’s a direct hit, and Goku hits the ground, looking even more dead this time…
 Goku is hit by Demon King Piccolo's Makosen Pilaf can’t believe the brat’s finally defeated, and Piccolo walks over to the fallen Goku and snatches the One-Star Ball from his neck. Piccolo flies back up to the airship, and says now they’ll go after the remaining Dragon Balls to restore his youth.
 Goku is defeated by Demon King Piccolo and loses a Dragon Ball Then the airship flies off, and Yajirobe comes out of hiding and looks over Goku’s body. He hears something, and bends down to hear that Goku’s heart is still beating!
 Yajirobe shouts and smacks him, but Goku won’t wake up. So, he throws Goku over his shoulder and runs off toward a river, then dunks him in head first. Goku’s awake now, pissed, but Yajirobe tells him it can’t be helped, that Piccolo Daimaō is a monster. Goku asks him if he knows where Karin Tower is, and Yajirobe asks what “Karin Tower” is. Goku explains that it’s a place, and asks Yajirobe to take him there, since he can barely move. Yajirobe says he will, so long as he gets him food like he promised.
 The little plane has landed, and Kame-Sen’nin and Tenshinhan are sifting through the grass. Chiaotzu has found the Three-Star Ball, bringing their total up to five balls. Kame-Sen’nin checks the Dragon Radar, and he says the last two are together. And they’re moving this way. Tenshinhan says that it must be Piccolo Daimaō, while Yajirobe and Goku speed off in air car toward Karin Tower.
"
The Muten-Rōshi's Decision,145,"The cover shows Master Roshi ready to do battle in the foreground, with King Piccolo, Piano, Emperor Pilaf, Mai, Shu, Tien, Chiaotzu, Goku, and Yajirobe in the background.
 Demon King Piccolo swallows the Dragon Balls Onboard his airship, Emperor Pilaf detects that the remaining five Dragon Balls are heading towards them. King Piccolo says that whoever has them is a fool for coming to them. At the same time, Master Roshi notes that Piccolo is coming towards them. He stresses that they cannot win if they fight Piccolo, and that their only option is to steal his Dragon Balls and have Shenron eliminate him. Meanwhile, Yajirobe continues escorting Goku to Korin Tower, and Goku tells him what the Dragon Balls do.
 King Piccolo and Master Roshi face off Meanwhile, Master Roshi finds a suitable area for his plan, and Tien lands the plane containing them and Chiaotzu. After having Chiaotzu bury the Dragon Balls, Master Roshi says that he and Tien will steal Piccolo's Dragon Balls when he lands looking for theirs. They will then throw the balls to Chiaotzu, who will put them with their five and make the wish. As Piccolo arrives, they hide among nearby rock formations. Before he descends from the airship, however, Piccolo eats his two Dragon Balls.
 Seeing this, Tien believes that they now must fight Piccolo. Roshi tells Tien that he will fight, then knocks Tien unconscious with some sort of sleeping gas so that he won't try to battle Piccolo himself. Roshi tells Chiaotzu to hide no matter what, then yells up to the airship to challenge Piccolo, telling him that the Dragon Balls are there. Piccolo descends and calls Roshi a fool for challenging him. Back among the rock formations, Tien is barely conscious.
"
The Mafū-Ba,146,"The cover shows Master Roshi in a fighting stance. King Piccolo looms menacingly in the background, while Goku and Yajirobe are seen riding in the latter's hovercar.
 King Piccolo tells Master Roshi that he is foolish for challenging him. Roshi tells him that they have met before, and reveals that his master was Master Mutaito. Piccolo is shocked by this revelation, and Roshi decapsulizes his Electric Rice Cooker. Tien realizes what Roshi is planning to do. On board the airship, Emperor Pilaf, Shu, and Mai are confused, but Piano seems to understand the threat.
 Roshi then attempts to use the Mafūba. Piccolo is quickly trapped within the technique, and Roshi seems to have everything under control. However, he misses in his attempt to seal Piccolo inside the rice cooker, the final part of the technique. Piccolo is released, and Roshi tells him that someday he will be defeated. Having finished the technique, Roshi dies. At that moment, Goku (who is riding with Yajirobe to Korin Tower) gets a strange feeling that something bad has happened, which Yajirobe brushes off.
 After briefly exulting in his victory, Piccolo telekinetically brings up Roshi's five Dragon Balls from the ground, then regurgitates his two. He happily claims that his youth will now be restored, as Tien watches helplessly.
"
The Demon King of Old... Restored!,147,"The cover shows King Piccolo with an evil smile on his face in the foreground, while Shenron is in the air behind him in the background.
 Having finally obtained all seven Dragon Balls, King Piccolo triumphantly announces that he will wish for youth. Piano and the Pilaf Gang celebrate on the airship. Tien is surprised to hear Piccolo's intention. Piccolo summons Shenron, and the sky grows dark. The dragon emerges, and the sight leaves everyone there in awe, including Piccolo.
 Realizing that they must act, Tien uses telepathy to tell Chiaotzu his plan: when Piccolo begins to make his wish, Chiaotzu will quickly make their wish first. Just as Piccolo begins to make his wish, Chiaotzu jumps out and interrupts him. Before he can finish saying the wish, however, Piccolo kills him with a single blast. Shenron asks Piccolo what his wish is, and Piccolo quickly states it. Shenron says it is a simple thing to do, and Piccolo is rapidly restored to the prime of his youth. Piccolo exults in his new power. Goku and Yajirobe notice that the sky is now dark, and Goku realizes that the dragon has been summoned. Just then, Yajirobe spots Korin Tower up ahead.

 Demon King Piccolo kills Shenlong Having regained his youth, King Piccolo exults in his new power. On board the airship, Piano and the Pilaf Gang celebrate. Shenron prepares to depart, but Piccolo attacks him with a Mouth Energy Wave. The blast hits and kills the dragon, shocking everyone else. An angry Tien, still unable to move, finally loses consciousness. Goku notices that all of the signals on the Dragon Radar are gone, and concludes that Piccolo did indeed call Shenron. As Goku wonders what Piccolo could have wished for, he and Yajirobe arrive at the base of Korin Tower. Upa and Bora are both overjoyed to see Goku, but they are also concerned about his injuries.
 Back on board the airship, Piccolo continues to celebrate his newfound strength. Emperor Pilaf timidly asks how much of the world Piccolo is willing to bequeath him, but Piccolo answers that he has no more use for him. Pilaf thinks that he is joking, but Piccolo opens a hole in the floor and drops Pilaf, Mai, and Shu out of the airship. At Korin Tower, Goku tells Bora and Upa that he wants to train with Korin again. Bora says that he'll never be able to make it up the tower in his state, but Goku responds that Yajirobe will carry him up. Yajirobe initially refuses, but Goku changes his mind with the promise of the holy Senzu Beans. Bora offers to help as well. The chapter ends with the Pilaf Gang, injured yet still alive after their fall.

Goku is leaping forward to attack, preparing to use his Power Pole, Tien is in a fighting pose, and Yajirobe is eating casually. This cover art is also featured in Daizenshuu 1.
 With Goku hanging onto Yajirobe's back, Bora throws the pair upwards to give them a head start on their trip up Korin Tower. When Yajirobe finally grabs on, he is surprised that he can't yet see the tower's top. Meanwhile, King Piccolo and Piano have arrived at King Castle in Central City. Piccolo quickly kills the two guards outside the main gate, using Eye Lasers to dispatch the second. He breaks down the metal gate and takes out another wave of guards as he heads for the compound's central building.
 King Piccolo finds the King of Earth Meanwhile, Goku and Yajirobe are still climbing Korin Tower. Yajirobe complains that they can't see the top yet, but admits that it would be too scary to go back down. Piccolo dispenses of another wave of guards inside the castle compound's central building. He then comes face to face with the Strong King's Guard. Piccolo sarcastically offers to let him join his side, which angers the guard. He attacks Piccolo, but his punch is easily blocked. Piccolo hits him in the face, then demands to know the location of King Furry. The guard refuses to tell, so Piccolo kills him with a strike through the chest.
 A nearby guard, seeing his comrade's fate, attempts to run. Piccolo gets in front of him and asks for King Furry's location. The guard nervously tells Piccolo that the king is in the western tower, and Piano spots the king's hovercar leaving. Piccolo leaps into the air, landing on the hovercar and startling the king, the Captain of the Guard, and the pilot. On Korin Tower, Yajirobe can finally see the top, but is upset when he discovers that Goku has fallen asleep.

Karin's Quandary,150,"The cover features a picture of a sick Akira Toriyama sitting down with an inkwell, some manga pages, and a cup of honey ginger tea. His cat Koge sits in front of him. The text around him tells that he had the flu when he wrote the chapter and was unable to draw a cover page. The text near his cat also reveals that Korin was inspired by Koge's sleeping face.
 Having landed on King Furry's hovercar, King Piccolo says that he will become the new king of the world. The Captain of the Guard tries to resist by shooting Piccolo, but it has no effect. Piccolo grabs him by the head. When King Furry tells him to let the Captain go, Piccolo complies by dropping him over the edge of the hovercar. Piccolo then tells Furry to announce to the world that he is their new king, but Furry refuses.
 King Piccolo wipes out a city King Piccolo then levels a large portion of Central City with a single blast, in an effort to force King Furry to cooperate. King Furry is shocked, and relents after Piccolo threatens more destruction. Meanwhile, Yajirobe and Goku have reached the top of Korin Tower. Korin is surprised that Yajirobe could carry Goku up, and Yajirobe is surprised that Korin is a cat. Goku begins to tell Korin what happened with Piccolo, but Korin already knows, and asks why Goku has come. Goku says that he wants to take down Piccolo, and Korin offers him a Senzu Bean to heal. Yajirobe, hungry, grabs a handful of the beans and eats them, causing his stomach to become enormously bloated.
 While Yajirobe lies incapacitated, Goku asks Korin to train him again. However, Korin says that Goku is now stronger than he is, and that he has nothing more to teach him. He also says that it is impossible to defeat King Piccolo. Goku angrily refuses to believe this and is ready to leave the tower to go after Piccolo again. Just as Goku is about to leave, Korin asks him if he wants to drink the Ultra Divine Water.
"
The Superest Super Water!!!,151,"The cover shows an anguished Goku and a grinning King Piccolo (with a globe behind him) in the background, and Korin with the Ultra Divine Water on his head in the foreground.
 Goku drinks the Ultra Divine Water Goku asks Korin what the Ultra Divine Water is, and whether drinking it will make him stronger. Korin says that he is not sure, and explains that the water draws out any remaining hidden power. Goku wonders if he has any hidden power left, and Yajirobe tells him to just drink it and find out. Korin then explains that the water is also a powerful toxin, and only those with tremendous stamina and will to live can survive to see their power unlocked. Korin admits that he could not handle the water, and spit it out. He further adds that fourteen strong warriors have attempted the feat, and none of them survived.
 Tien practices the Evil Containment Wave Yajirobe complains that it sounds like just regular poison, but Goku decides to drink it anyways. Yajirobe tries to change his mind, but Goku is defiant and says the water is the only way he can avenge his friends. Yajirobe relents, and Korin brings the Ultra Divine Water over to them. Yajirobe decides to try just a taste, and spits it out almost immediately. Goku is undeterred, and drinks the entire cup at once. He quickly falls to the ground in agony.
 Meanwhile, Tien is practicing the Evil Containment Wave. He misses his attempt to get the wave to land in the Electric Rice Cooker. He vows to master the wave in order to defeat Piccolo. The next morning at dawn, Goku has been writhing in pain for six hours. Yajirobe is concerned for him, but just then Goku's body finally manages to defeat the water's poison. Goku sits up and states that he is overflowing with power. Meanwhile, Tien finally manages to master the Evil Containment Wave.
"
Piccolo's World,152,"The cover shows Goku in the foreground flexing his biceps. King Piccolo is shown grinning behind him on the left. Tien is shown flying an airplane over King Castle in the top right, while a concerned Yamcha and Bulma are in the bottom right.
 As he flies away from the battle with King Piccolo, Tien radios Kame House and tells Yamcha that they failed to gather the Dragon Balls, and that Master Roshi and Chiaotzu have perished. He also informs them that King Piccolo summoned Shenron and regained his youth, making him much more powerful. He tells Yamcha the location of the bodies, and Yamcha says there is no point fighting Piccolo any more. Tien reveals that he has mastered the Evil Containment Wave and plans on using it against Piccolo. Yamcha says that they should try to have Shenron defeat Piccolo instead, and then revive the others. Just then, Oolong gets their attention, saying that something about Piccolo is on the television.
 Demon King Piccolo delivers a televised speech King Furry appears on their television screen, saying that his throne has been taken by King Piccolo. He then begs for someone to take him down, and Piccolo steps onscreen. He briefly chokes Furry before taking the foreground. Tien realizes that Piccolo must be at King Castle. Piccolo says that he has already demonstrated his power, and that the two words he hates most are ""peace"" and ""justice."" He claims that he will abolish every law enforcement agency and allow evil, terror, and hate to flourish. Launch, in her bad form, says that it does not sound too bad to her.
 Back on Korin Tower, Goku says that he feels calm, yet overflowing with power after surviving the Ultra Divine Water. Korin is surprised at Goku's abilities, while Yajirobe says that Goku looks the same. Goku claims that he can feel King Piccolo's power in a certain direction, and decides to head that way. Goku says that he will win, and Korin agrees, then tells him that he will give him what he wants. Korin summons a massive Flying Nimbus and tells Goku to take a piece, telling him that his original one came from this giant cloud. Goku jumps down and takes a piece for himself before offering Yajirobe a ride, an offer which is hurriedly declined. Goku thanks Korin and flies off to battle Piccolo. Yajirobe asks for his own Flying Nimbus, but Korin says that he probably could not ride one. As Korin marvels at Goku's newfound power, King Piccolo tells the people of Earth that the greatest horrors are yet to come.
"
Tenshinhan's Resolve,153,"The cover shows Tien Shinhan looking up determinedly at a grinning King Piccolo, with King Castle in the background on the right.
 Tien notices the electric rice cooker is broken As King Piccolo's television broadcast continues, he shows the people of Earth a box containing 43 numbered cards, one for each of the planet's districts. He says that every year on May 9, the date of his ascension, he will draw a card and destroy the corresponding district. He also challenges anyone who disagrees with this to try and stop him. Yamcha, watching form Kame House, and Tien, en route to the castle in an airplane, are outraged at the message. Tien vows to defeat Piccolo with the Evil Containment Wave. Piccolo then draws card number 29 out of the box, which he reveals is the district containing West City. Realizing that her parents are in danger, Bulma calls Tien and implores him to use the Evil Containment Wave, promising to revive him with the Dragon Balls if he does.
 Tien says that he will indeed use the Evil Containment Wave, but informs Bulma that Shenron has been killed. An angered Yamcha vows to go fight as well. Tien reaches King Castle and sees Piccolo as he and Piano are about to take off in a hovercar. Tien yells out a challenge to the tyrant, who decides that he will make an example of Tien to discourage others from attacking him as well. Meanwhile, Goku approaches on his new Flying Nimbus. Piccolo and Piano descend to the ground outside King Castle, and Piccolo invites Tien to do the same. As he is about to descend, Tien is shocked to see that his Electric Rice Cooker has cracked. Despite realizing that he cannot use the Evil Containment Wave now, Tien nevertheless descends to fight.
 Piccolo is surprised that Tien can fly, but is still undaunted. Tien says that Piccolo is arrogant. Piccolo says that he will first introduce Tien to his new servant, as the situation is not worth dirtying his hands over. Piccolo, much to Tien's confusion, spits up a large egg. A large, hideous monster quickly hatches, which Piccolo names Drum. Tien vows to show them his abilities.
"
Tenshinhan vs. Drum,154,"The cover shows Goku grinning in the foreground, while the background shows Tien Shinhan and Drum about to face off at King Castle as King Piccolo watches.
 King Piccolo tells the newly spawned Drum to finish off Tien quickly, as they do not have time to play games. At the same time, Goku has almost reached King Castle on his Flying Nimbus. Tien says that even if he dies, he will take both of them down with him. He then dashes at Drum and attacks, but Drum dodges and punches at Tien. Tien blocks the punch and kicks several times, but Drum dodges and then connects with a punch to the face. He follows up with two kicks and an elbow, the last of which sends Tien flying backwards. King Piccolo says that Tien seems like a dull one. Tien recovers in midair and sends himself hurtling towards Drum, and headbutts him in the face.
 Drum, however, seems mostly unaffected, and simply tells Tien that he has some good moves. Tien marvels at the strength and speed of Drum, and realizes that Piccolo's must be even greater. Drum then tells Tien that he is already dead, then quickly moves behind Tien. He hits Tien with a punch to the back, sending him to the ground. King Piccolo says that Tien is persistent, and orders Drum to tear out his heart. As Drum stands over Tien and prepares to do as commanded, he is suddenly knocked to the ground, much to Piccolo's confusion.
 Goku, having arrived at the scene of the battle, looks angrily at King Piccolo. Piccolo and Tien are both shocked, having believed that Goku was dead. Tien is glad to see that Goku is alive, and Goku says that he thought it was Tien fighting Piccolo. Goku asks if Piccolo changed his face, and Piccolo informs him that he has regained his youth and is now much more powerful. Tien tells Goku to run, but a now-risen Drum tells Goku that he will not allow that. King Piccolo tells Drum to kill both Goku and Tien, and Drum begins to move to attack Goku. Goku, however, hits Drum with a knee to the face. Piccolo and Tien are stunned.

King Piccolo and Tien Shinhan are stunned at what has occurred. Goku lands and glares at Piccolo as the dead Drum falls to the ground. Tien marvels at Goku's new power, noting that he is much stronger than before. Piccolo is angry that Goku continues to defy him, and Goku says that he will not die until he takes Piccolo down. Meanwhile, Bulma, Yamcha, and Launch fly towards King Castle, while Oolong and the others go to find the bodies of Master Roshi and Chiaotzu. Launch, in her bad form, says that she will not let Piccolo get away if anything has happened to Tien. Yamcha says that they are glad to have her around at times like these. Just then Launch sneezes, reverting to her good form, and asks if they are going on a picnic.
 At King Castle, Piccolo tells Goku that he has become much more powerful, but Goku says that he is more powerful as well. Piccolo tells Goku that he will die in five seconds, and charges at him. However, Goku blocks his strike, leaving Piccolo, Tien, and Piano stunned. Piccolo punches again, and Goku grabs his hand and throws him through one of the buildings in the castle complex. The building is destroyed, but Piccolo emerges from the rubble, and Goku tells him that the five seconds are up. Piccolo tells Goku to prepare to die, leaps into the air, and flies towards Goku. As he approaches, he fires a Ki Blast, which Goku leaps into the air to dodge. Piccolo grins, then lands at fires another blast at the falling Goku. Realizing that he cannot dodge, Goku puts up his arms to block.
 The blast directly hits the blocking Goku's arms, and sends him flying backwards. He manages to grab a spike protruding from another castle building and swings on it before landing on the ground below. A horrified Piccolo asks what Goku is.

Piccolo tells Goku that the moment he sees Piccolo's true power will be his last. Goku says that Piccolo took away a lot that he cared about, and that he will not get away with it. The two stare each other down, and then Goku dashes towards Piccolo with incredible speed, punching him in the face. As he falls over, Piccolo lands on Piano. Tien is amazed at Goku's speed, thinking that he could hardly see Goku's movements. Piccolo gets back on his feet and tells Goku that he will pay, then dashes at him. Goku dodges his strike and kicks at Piccolo's feet, but the demon king dodges. The two then leap towards each other again, but Goku jumps right into a kick from Piccolo.
 Sent flying backwards by the kick, Goku recovers and sends himself darting towards Piccolo, connecting with a knee to the chest. He follows up with a series of punches and finally another kick, which sends Piccolo tottering backwards. Piccolo regains his composure, and then laughs and tells Goku that he is the first opponent to injure him so severely. Tien wonders why Piccolo is laughing. Goku tells him to fight at full power, and Piccolo says that he is not surprised Goku noticed he was holding back. He says that fighting at full power shortens his life, but that it is necessary to defeat Goku. He then begins to power up, and Tien marvels at his ki.
 Goku then says that he can begin fighting at full power as well. Piccolo dismisses this as nonsense, but Goku says there is only one way to find out. Piccolo then lightly swings his arm, and the force of the movement creates a powerful gust of wind which moves Goku back. Goku and Tien are surprised at the strength of the gust generated by such a light swing.
"
The Immortal Battle,157,"The cover is Goku in the foreground throwing a kick, with King Piccolo in the background throwing a punch.
 Goku's Bending Kamehameha fired at King Piccolo The fight with Piccolo and Goku continues. Piccolo and Goku are both becoming tired of playing around, and both decide to get serious. Piccolo powers up, and punches Goku. This sends Goku flying back and creating a huge crater in the ground.
 All hope seems lost for a moment, as Goku does not seem to be getting back up. Tien Shinhan even states ""It' all over!"" Finally, before all hope is lost, Goku springs out of the crater and fires a Bending Kamehameha at Piccolo. Piccolo prepares to block the head on attack, but the Kamehameha bends around Piccolo and strikes him in the back of the head. Piccolo is shaken up by the blast, and extremely angered. Piccolo and Goku then charge each other, continuing in battle once again. Both clash, each landing a fair amount of strong punches and kicks on one another.
 King Furry is seen with one of his guards, watching the intense battle, amazed with Goku's power.
 King Piccolo is hit by Goku's Bending Kamehameha Piccolo and Goku continue to fight, exchanging blow for blow. Finally, King Piccolo seems to have gained the advantage after blasting one of Goku's legs with his Eye Lasers. Goku quickly comes of with a plan to use his Power Pole to launch himself at Piccolo. The plan is successful, and Goku delivers an incredibly hard knee to King Piccolo's face.
 Next, Bulma and Yamucha are seen flying towards the battle scene, in an attempt to help Tien Shinhan (not knowing Goku has arrived at the battle scene). A news report begins, and Bulma and Yamucha are excited to hear the battle is still going on, and there is still time to arrive. They also hear that there are two people fighting King Piccolo and are eager to find out who this second person is, assuming it is Goku.
 We then head back to the battle scene where King Piccolo powers up, yet again. Piccolo blasts away Goku's power pole, then charges his Explosive Demon Wave, and the chapter ends.
"
Goku's Greatest Crisis!,158,"The cover feature King Piccolo and Goku fighting each other, King Piccolo is blocking an elbow from Goku, and preparing to throw a punch.
 Goku survives King Piccolo's Explosive Demon Wave The chapter begins with a very confident King Piccolo, boasting, thinking he had defeated Goku with his Explosive Demon Wave. Suddenly, King Piccolo stops boasting, due to still being able to sense Goku's ki. It is then seen that Tien Shinhan used the last of his energy to save Goku from the monstrous blast.
 Goku then goes back to continue his fight with Piccolo. Goku taunts King Piccolo in attempt to get him to charge his Explosive Demon wave again, due to it being his one moment of weakness. A very arrogant King Piccolo accepts, and begins charging the beam. With this one free moment, Goku hops using all of his energy on his good leg, and delivers an extremely hard punch to King Piccolo.
 The blast knocks Piccolo backs a couple of steps, but has nowhere near enough energy to do him in. King Piccolo then fires another Explosive Demon Wave, this time a direct hit on Goku. The impact creates a giant crater one the ground, and injures Goku greatly. Goku then calls his Kinto'un to pull him out. Piccolo is surprised to see Goku survived the blast, and even becomes slightly nervous at his strength. As a last ditch effort, Piccolo grabs Tenshinhan and promises to crush his head if Goku does not obey him.
"
The Blasted Earth,159,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku and King Piccolo facing each other angrily.
 The explosion continues, and Yamcha wonders why the TV’s cut out in their plane. Bulma points out the mushroom cloud up ahead, coming from King Castle’s direction. The King and his two guards have just barely managed to escape in a little plane, and the King is upset about the town and King Castle. Piccolo stands in the newly formed barren wasteland, and laughs about his victory. But then he freaks out, since he can still feel his ki.
 Piccolo looks up and spots Tenshinhan in the air holding Goku, and gets pissed about that guy who knows Bukūjutsu still being here. Tenshinhan comes down to the ground, and Goku thanks him. But, Tenshinhan’s really exhausted, and Goku asks Ten-san what’s wrong. Piccolo realizes using Bukūjutsu just then must’ve taken the last of his power, and combined with Goku’s injured leg, Piccolo thinks he has this won.
 Piccolo starts powering up, and says not to mess with his Bakuriki-Maha. This time, Goku’s not going to wait it out, and he rushes at Piccolo and hits him in the stomach. Piccolo is only affected for a short time, and Goku realizes he has less power with only one leg. Piccolo then launches his his Bakuriki-Maha, and Goku shields himself to take it head on.
 There’s a huge explosion, and Tenshinhan is down. The smoke clears and there’s a huge hole in the ground where Goku was, and Piccolo thinks it’s all over. “K-Kinto-Un…!” Kinto-Un whooshes over to the hole, and comes back up with Goku hanging from it. Piccolo can’t believe it, and Goku says Piccolo must be losing his strength after all. Piccolo refuses to believe he, Piccolo Daimaō, could be opposed by a mere human, and Goku says since he has a tail, he’s probably not human. Goku says he’s also lost most of his strength, so they’ll just battle it out to the death. But Piccolo won’t have that, and he reaches over and grabs Tenshinhan by the head. “Alright then, try moving!! I’ll smash this guy’s head if you do!!”
"
Goku's Final Gamble,160,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku standing with his fist slightly raised. Behind him are a Great Ape and King Piccolo, who is holding Tien Shinhan by his head.
 Piccolo threatens to kill Tenshinhan if Goku moves, but Tenshinhan tells him to just kill Piccolo and not to worry about him. Piccolo thinks he’s said too much, and starts to squeeze Tenshinhan’s head. Goku yells to stop, and says he’ll do as he likes. Piccolo tells him not to move, and then picks up a rock and blows it at Goku, disabling his left arm. Piccolo says that humanity’s weakness is its generosity, and Goku hesitates, then insists that they’ll kill him somehow or other, and Piccolo asks how. “Ten-san, forgive me! I’m gonna defeat Piccolo!!!”
 Goku fires a Kamehameha into the ground Piccolo can’t believe he’d just let him die, and Goku insists he’ll return him to life with the Dragon Balls. Piccolo laughs and says how he got rid of Shenlong, and Goku can’t believe it. Goku’s at a loss again, and so Piccolo blows another rock at him, taking out his left leg, and knocking Goku down. Piccolo laughs at how Goku can’t stand up right now, he’s like a green caterpillar. Piccolo doesn’t need Tenshinhan anymore, so he drops him to the ground. He’ll take this one out later, but first he needs to take care of the brat.
 Goku charges towards King Piccolo Piccolo laughs at how Goku can’t do anything, so it finally ends here. Piccolo flies high up into the air, and prepares to take out this person who’s kept him from making this a world of darkness. Piccolo then dives down at Goku, but Goku says he’s mistaken, he has one remaining arm. Goku charges up this arm, then points it down at the ground, and fires a Kamehameha down, projecting himself into the air toward Piccolo. Goku puts everything into this fist, as Piccolo prepares to fire a counter blast down at him.
 
"
The Fist of Son Goku,161,"The cover of this chapter shows an injured Goku making a peace sign with his fingers.
 Goku kills King Piccolo Picking up from the previous chapter, the chapter starts out with Goku flying towards King Piccolo. The demon desperately tries in vain to block Goku, but is completely pierced through his chest by Goku's body. Before dying, King Piccolo spits out an egg containing his last son and he then explodes, disappearing once and for all. Goku falls to the ground and is caught by Yajirobe, who takes him away in his hovercar. The others catch up with Tien Shinhan, and Bulma tells the TV station that Piccolo is dead and the world is safe. The chapter ends on an ominous note with Piccolo Jr. hatching from his egg and claiming that he will avenge his father.
"
The Niyoi-bo's Secret,162,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku from behind, wearing damaged clothing, and with the Power Pole strapped to his back.
 Up atop Karin Tower, Goku is celebrating his recovery. Karin congratulates Goku about defeating Piccolo, saying he was mostly sure that Goku would win. But not completely sure, and if Goku had died, he would’ve gathered the Dragon Balls himself and returned all the killed people to life. Goku is surprised to hear that Karin knows about the Dragon Balls. “Hmph. Of course I do. There’s nothing I don’t know!”
 Yajirobe asks Karin just how he plans on reviving anyone with Shenlong killed, and Karin seems surprised to hear that. Goku gets pissed about this, and Yajirobe tells him its fate. Karin says the souls of those killed by the Demon Clan won’t pass on to the other world, as they’ll just float around in space, and Yajirobe’s glad he didn’t die. Goku thinks there has to be something they can do, and Karin tells him it’s hopeless without Shenlong.
 But then Karin gets an idea, and can’t believe he’s forgotten something so important. Goku asks what it is, and Karin tells him he should ask the person who created the Dragon Balls to revive Shenlong. Goku wants to know who that is, and Karin tells him it’s… God. “God…?” Yajirobe thinks Goku’s a real idiot if he doesn’t know who God is, and Karin tells Goku he’ll permit him to meet with God. Goku has the qualifications to meet with him, although Yajirobe doesn’t.
 Goku asks where this person is, and Karin tells him he’s at God’s Palace, up above Karin Tower. Yajirobe thinks he’s kidding, this is supposed to be the top. Karin tells him to hush, and explains that it’s floating high in the air above Karin Tower. It’s too high for them to even see it from here. Goku says he’ll just use Kinto-Un, but Karin says Kinto-Un can’t go up there. Yajirobe suggests using rockets, and Karin says there’s only one way to get up there. Goku is worried he’ll have to jump or something.
 Karin says the way to get up there is pretty simple — the Nyoi-Bō. Karin explains that the Nyoi-Bō was once what linked this World to God’s Palace, until he lent it to Muten Rōshi. Goku realizes Kame-Sen’nin must have passed it on to Grandpa, and then Grandpa it to him, as he reaches for the Nyoi-Bō. But, it’s not strapped to his back, and Goku freaks out. Goku realizes he left it behind after fighting Piccolo, and calls Kinto-Un and goes after it.
 Goku looks all over the battlefield, but he can’t find it, and he’s really worried, until he remembers, “When worried, see Uranai Baba…” So, Goku hops back on Kinto-Un and zooms over to her place. Goku explains to Baba that he wants to know where his Nyoi-Bō is, and tells her to hurry up and bring out the five people so he can beat ‘em. Baba says she’ll give him a free fortune telling, though, because of the great things he’s done.
 Baba hops off of her crystal ball and looks into it, and says it’s in this house here. Goku wonders why it would be at Kame House, then zooms off again. Baba says he really did rescue the world, and he’ll also be the first human to be able to meet God. The ghost next to her says he’s never seen such a great person before.
 Goku bursts in the door at Kame House asking where the Nyoi-Bō is, and everyone’s happy and surprised to see him. Then Goku spots it, and rushes over and grabs it, saying how he’s going to return everyone to life by visiting God as he rushes out the door. Then he zooms off again, leaving everyone wondering what the Hell he was talking about…
 Goku returns to Karin Tower, and takes a second to catch his breath. Now that he has the Nyoi-Bō, they can move on. So, the three of them climb out onto the roof of Karin Tower, and there’s a big connector in the center that has a little hole in the tip. Karin says to put the Nyoi-Bō in the hole, and then he can make it grow to reach God’s Palace. He gives Goku a little bell, and says it’ll prove his worth. Yajirobe thinks it would be impolite for Goku to meet God looking all tattered like that, but Karin says it won’t matter, since he’ll just get messed up again…
"
The Sanctuary of Kami-sama,163,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku walking towards a building on the Lookout. Below is also Goku wearing shorts. This cover art is also featured in Daizenshuu 1.
 Yajirobe wants to know what he means about Goku’s clothes getting tattered up there, and Goku asks if God’s a dangerous person. Karin explains that he’ll be tested up there, but he has faith in Goku. Yajirobe doesn’t like the sound of that, but Goku’s not worried. “Okaaaaay, here goes!! Extend, Nyoi-Bō!!” Goku shoots up there, and Karin thinks Goku will be shocked when he sees God’s face. Yajirobe asks if his face is that frightening, but Karin says it’s not frightening, just familiar.
 The Nyoi-Bō keeps shooting up, and then Goku finally sees the place. It’s huge, and round, but flat on the top. It’s like the bottom half of a sphere. The Nyoi-Bō finally stops, connecting in another big connector with a little hole in the tip, and Goku spots a ladder up above him. He swings up from the Nyoi-Bō to the ladder, and climbs all the way up to the flat surface.
 The floor is tiled, no walls or ceiling, and there’s all kinds of nicely kept trees, and a temple on the other side. There’s a guy standing in the middle of the floor, with black skin and big eyes and lips. The two greet each other, and Goku asks him if he’s God. “I am Mister Popo. God’s servant.”
 Popo compliments his work in defeating Piccolo Daimaō, and Goku asks how he knows that. “God knows everything. God is great.” Goku looks behind Popo, and asks if that is God’s house, and wants to go there. “You’ve brought proof of Karin’s approval?” Goku shows him the little bell, and so Popo says he’ll test him now. “You’ll have a match with Mister Popo. If you beat Mister Popo, you can meet God.” Goku thinks this’ll be simple, and says to hurry it up. “You’re the first human to come here. This test will be fun.”
 Goku starts things off by leaving an afterimage, but Popo just throws a punch out and hits Goku in the face. “Ah! Success.” Goku wasn’t expecting this, and tells Popo to get ready this time. Goku rushes at him, saying it’ll be over with this one hit, but Popo just nonchalantly throws out another punch. “Success again. You’re not strong. You’re weak. You really defeated Piccolo Daimaō?” Goku gets pissed at being called weak, and decides to get serious. “Really? I’m glad.”
 Goku comes at Popo with a kick, but Popo vanishes, then appears behind Goku and kicks him. Goku flies toward a tree, then swings around it and flies at Popo with another kick. But, Popo catches his leg, and then throws him across the floor. “Mister Popo is disappointed.” Goku gets pissed at being called weak again, and rushes at Popo, but Popo blocks all of his punches. Then Goku swipes at him, but Popo flies up over it and floats in the air. “Testing you is pointless. Go home.”
"
Enter God,164,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku in tattered clothes looking amazed. Mr. Popo is seen standing behind him.
 Goku arrives on Kami's Lookout Goku can’t believe this, as Popo tells him that while he might’ve been strong down there, up here, things are different. “Now, go home, go home.” Goku insists he can’t leave, he has to meet with God to return everyone to life. Then Goku asks if he can use this place for some special training, and Popo says to do as he likes, though it’s futile. So, Goku tries to run some laps around the place, but then he gets dizzy and has to stop. “This is incredibly high in the sky. The air is thin,” says Popo.
 Popo says something about moving faster than thunder when you’re calm, and Goku thinks it’s a bit difficult. Popo says it’s like this; your mind has to be empty. Blank expression. Goku says that’s real calm, he can’t feel his ki at all. Goku gets a blank expression on his face, too, but Popo says that’s just not thinking, it isn’t emptiness. Goku thinks this is hard.
 Popo then demonstrates the moving faster than thunder by instantly moving behind Goku, and Goku says he couldn’t see anything. Popo has his back to Goku, and says he even knows that Goku’s touching his face with his right hand right now. “How did you know that!? Do you have eyes in the back of your head?!” Popo explains that he doesn’t rely on his eyes to see, he feels the movements in the air.
 Goku says there’s no way he could win against Mister Popo, and Popo says he’s learned a lot from God. Goku asks if God’s even more amazing than Popo, and Popo says he’s much more amazing. Goku’s happy to be around such strong people, but then asks Popo why God didn’t beat up Piccolo if he’s so strong. Popo says God has his reasons. Then Popo tells Goku he should keep going until he can beat him, but Popo doesn’t know how many years it’ll take. Goku doesn’t mind that.
 Goku attacks Mr. Popo A voice calls out, and Goku asks Popo if it’s God, and it is. God says he’ll meet with him, and Goku gets excited. Popo leads Goku over to the temple, and they wait outside the grand entrance. God slowly walks out, and he looks just like… “Piccolo!!!! You bastard, so you’re still alive!!!” Goku flies over at God, but he just flicks him away, with Popo catching Goku. God is also a wrinkly old green guy with pointy ears and antennae, but he has the kanji for “God” (kami) on his outfit instead, and he has a staff.
 God can’t believe that mischievous punk Karin didn’t tell Goku anything, and so he decides to explain things. Long ago, he and Piccolo were once one genius martial artist. He’d come here to learn from God, but, unfortunately, God died. He wanted to become God’s successor, but he couldn’t, because he had this evil dwelling in the bottom of his heart. So, he trained fiercely until he could drive out that evil. The evil was Piccolo Daimaō. Piccolo fled from here to terrorize the people below, until Goku defeated him.
 God says he’ll give Goku something as thanks, so long as Goku will stay here and train. Goku is more than happy to do that, and then God says he also knows why he’s come here. As God, he can’t personally return people to life. But, Shenlong is his creation, and so he can return him to life. Now, he’ll return Shenlong to life, and revive the Dragon Balls!
"
Shen Long Resurrected!,165,"The cover of this chapter shows Tien Shinhan, Krillin, Goku, Master Roshi, Chaiotzu and Yamcha all standing with their arms crossed.
 The bottom of the page has Goku holding up a toy car while saying, ""Everyone, help me think up some new clothes!""
 God tells Popo to go get Shenlong, and so Popo comes back with a glass encased little Shenlong statue. It’s in pieces, just like the real Shenlong was, and God asks Popo to fix it. Popo sits down and glues the pieces back together, and Goku asks about this thing. Popo made this, and God breathed life into it. God explains that he gave the Dragon Balls to the people below to give them courage and hope, but they didn’t use it for good things, just greed. God says Goku’s not like that, though, and then Popo’s finished.
 God tells them to stand aside, and he fires a magic blast over at the Shenlong statue. Then Shenlong shoots out of it down toward the Earth, and God explains that he’s going back to the Dragon Balls. Normally they’d be ordinary stones for the span of a year, but in this case, a wish can already be granted. Goku’s excited to get to see everyone again already, but God says he’s staying here to train. After persevering for three years, he can see his friends again at the next Tenka’ichi Budōkai.
 Goku asks why until then, so God tells him Piccolo will surely be there, targeting Goku’s life. Goku freaks out, because he thought he’d defeated him. God explains that just before he exploded, Piccolo had left behind an offspring. That offspring is getting stronger to exact revenge on Goku, and so if Goku stays here and trains for three years, he’ll certainly be able to defeat Piccolo this time. He and Mister Popo can’t fight him, so only Goku can do it.
 Goku says he wants to start training immediately, but first, he has to piss, and asks where the toilet is. God and Popo fall over, and then Popo points Goku in the temple through the grand entrance. Goku runs in, and then Popo asks God that since he and Piccolo were once one, if Piccolo is defeated, God also dies. God says it’s unavoidable, and it’s his duty. He’s been meaning to do this for a long time, but he’s just been waiting for the right person to come along to replace him. And he thinks Son Goku just might be it.
 The Dragon Balls are gathered on Kame-Sen’nin’s island, and Shenlong has appeared in all his awesomeness. Bulma says he was dead, and Shenlong explains that Son Goku asked God to return him to life. They wonder about this, so Shenlong says that he’s training for the next Tenka’ichi Budōkai in the Heavenly Realm. They can meet him again at the Budōkai. So, Shenlong’s going to grant the wish now, since he already knows what it is.
 Kuririn wakes up, followed by Kame-Sen’nin and Chiaotzu! And elsewhere, Namu and Giran each wake up as well! Then the Dragon Balls disperse, and some time passes. The newly revived people have been told of Piccolo’s defeat, and Kame-Sen’nin asks just where Goku is now. Yamcha tells him that Shenlong said he’s training in the Heavenly Realm, and apparently Kame-Sen’nin knows of that. If Goku’s training there, then he’s learning from God.
 Kuririn can’t believe this, and Kame-Sen’nin says Goku’s on a much different level than them now, leaving even him in the dust. Yamcha wonders just how much stronger Goku will become, and Tenshinhan says he’s anxious to see this God training at the next Budōkai, and the others agree. Speaking of which, Goku is up there meditating, and doesn’t much like this sitting still. God says he needs to train his soul before anything else. And Tenshinhan, Yamcha, and Kuririn are all training on Earth for their reunion with Goku.
"
The Reunion,166,"The cover of this chapter shows a picture of the World Martial Arts Tournament Area.
 It’s pouring rain outside of the Tenka’ichi Budōkai grounds, and Kame-Sen’nin and Lunch are standing with an umbrella, thinking the others are late. Then a taxi pulls up, and Bulma, Oolong, and Pu’er all get out. Kame-Sen’nin is amazed at the woman Bulma’s become, and she elbows him in the face for touching her ass. Kame-Sen’nin thinks her personality hasn’t matured, and Bulma says it’s the same with him.
 Kame-Sen’nin asks why Yamcha’s not with them, and Pu’er and Oolong explain that he left West City to train by himself. Kame-Sen’nin says Kuririn did the same, influenced by Goku’s absence. “Ossu!” Kame-Sen’nin asks Bulma if she knows this tall dude in the turban, but she doesn’t. “It’s real good to see you alive, Gramps! Everyone else also looks healthy! Where’s Kuririn, Yamcha, Tenshinhan, and everyone else? Are they already in the preliminaries hall?”
 Everyone wonders if he could be… it’s Goku! He thinks it should be pretty obvious, and he gets excited when the rain stops. Goku realizes this thing on his head must make it hard to tell, and so he takes off the turban and says it must be unmistakable now (with his silly hair showing). Goku thinks Bulma and Kame-Sen’nin have shrunk, but Bulma tells him he’s just gotten huge. Goku says his hair hasn’t grown, though.
 Goku asks Bulma if she has a disease because her lips are all red, and she yells at him that it’s lipstick. And then four more fighters show up together: Yamcha, with long hair again and some scars on his face; Kuririn, a little taller, but not nearly as big as Yamcha or Tenshinhan; and Tenshinhan and Chiaotzu are the same, wearing the same outfits as they did to the last Budōkai, but instead of having the kanji for tsuru (“crane”) on their outfits they have ten (“heavens”) and gyō (“gyōza”), respectively.
 Yamcha doesn’t think much of their reaction (everyone’s a bit underwhelmed), and Kuririn thinks they must just be surprised at how they’ve all changed. (But actually, they’re just more taken with Goku’s arrival.) Kuririn tells Muten Rōshi to look at how he’s grown, and then Goku tells Kuririn he seems healthy. Goku says everyone’s here now, and Kuririn asks if that’s really him. Then Kuririn runs over and hugs Goku, crying, and Yamcha and Tenshinhan are surprised that it’s really him.
 Some time passes, and a guy with a megaphone asks for the participants to head to the competition hall. Goku asks Kame-Sen’nin about giving them a dōgi, but Kame-Sen’nin tells him that since they’re all doing fine walking their own path there’s no need for them to wear the Kame (“turtle”) dōgi. Then they all prepare to leave, but first, Tenshinhan leans over and asks Muten Rōshi if he’ll be competing this time. Kame-Sen’nin whispers that he’ll pass, since he can’t compete with these guys anymore. Bulma thinks Goku has grown up really well, and Oolong thinks she’s a bimbo.
 Inside, Kuririn has changed into a Kame dōgi he had made at a dōgi shop, and Yamcha says they’ve thought alike, as he’s wearing one as well. And Goku too, and then Yamcha asks him about his tail. Goku says God got rid of it because he wanted to restore the destroyed moon. For some reason, his tail was interfering with that… Then Goku feels something, and Yamcha and Kuririn wonder what’s up. Goku has spotted a green guy with pointy ears, a turban, and a mantle — Piccolo’s offspring, and he’s already grown to adult size. Yamcha and Kuririn ask Goku if they know this guy, but Tenshinhan recognizes him.
"
New Challengers,167,"The cover of this chapter shows Yamcha, Chaiotzu, Goku, Krillin and Tien Shinhan smiling.
 Piccolo's offspring and Goku smirk at each other, and then Piccolo’s offspring coldly walks off. Tenshinhan asks if one of Piccolo Daimaō’s henchmen had survived, and Goku tells him to keep this quiet, as not to cause a commotion. Yamcha, Kuririn, and Chiaotzu wonder what’s up, and Goku tells them they were just saying that guy was strong.
 A girl then comes up and taps Goku on the shoulder, and she knows his name is Son Goku. Goku asks who she is, and then she gets pissed and walks off. Kuririn asks who that cute girl was, but Goku doesn’t know, and Kuririn’s jealous. Then an official says the preliminaries will begin. This time there are only seventy-two entrants, considerably less than last time. The drawings for the preliminary blocks begin, and Tenshinhan telepathically tells Chiaotzu to scatter the gang’s numbers, along with that guy (Piccolo’s offspring).
 Goku gets #2, so he's in Block One's first match. Kuririn is impressed at how they’re all scattered across the blocks, and Chiaotzu gives us the peace sign. So, now the preliminary matches to determine the eight finalists will begin, and everyone is told to head to their proper blocks. Over at Block One, an official tells #1 and #2 to get onto the contest platform, and Kuririn tells Goku he’s anxious to see God’s training.
 Tenshinhan and Yamcha notice Goku’s up, and decide to go watch with Kuririn. Goku’s opponent is once again King Chapa, and Chapa says that it won’t be like before. The match is called to begin, but Goku doesn’t budge, and Chapa starts to get pissed. Yamcha says he can’t feel a trace of Goku, and Tenshinhan says Goku’s become completely empty, and King Chapa can’t win. Chapa charges at Goku, and kicks at him, but Goku’s gone. Chapa thinks maybe he’s in the air like last time, but Goku is behind him, and pops Chapa on the back of the neck for a knockout.
 Everyone’s impressed, including Piccolo’s offspring, although he thinks Goku couldn’t possibly win against him with those moves. And so, Kuririn, Yamcha, and Tenshinhan each win their matches. Chiaotzu, on the other hand, gets trashed, and he loses. His opponent has some weird helmet thing on his head, and goggle things for eyes, who says Chiaotzu’s still alive, but only because he didn’t want to get disqualified. Tenshinhan looks up at the opponent, who greets both Tenshinhan and Son Goku. “T-Tao Pai-pai!?”
"
The 8 Finalists,168,"The cover of this chapter shows various characters such as Piccolo Jr., Tien Shinhan, Krillin, Goku and Yamcha.
 Goku cannot believe this, and Tenshinhan says he is supposed to be dead. Tao Pai-pai says he does not die so easily, and explains that he was revived, though it took a while. Kuririn asks Goku who this is, so Goku explains that he is a hitman, as well as Tsuru-Sen’nin's little brother. So, he is like Tenshinhan and Chiaotzu's senpai, and Goku was sure he would defeated him. Tao Pai-pai says he used all the money he would earned to be revived as a cyborg, as well as getting his power increased exponentially.
 Tao Pai-pai does not care about winning the tournament, he just wants to take the life of Son Goku. And after that, Tenshinhan, who has betrayed them for the Kame School. Tenshinhan says he has not taken up the Kame-Style, he has just realized their teachings were no good. Tenshinhan tells him they will fight, and Tao Pai-pai thinks it will be fun.
 Piccolo's offspring wins a match by flicking this guy, and Kuririn says a lot of really amazing people have gathered this time. Goku thinks that this offspring has surpassed the previous Piccolo. Then, Goku has another match, and he easily wins it, so #2 places in the finals. Then #35 (Tenshinhan), #16 (Kuririn), #22 (Yamcha), and #51 (Piccolo Jr.) each place as well. Tao Pai-pai has apparently also placed, and also the cute girl from before, #59. Goku thinks she does seem a bit familiar.
 Now, there is only one match left. The two contestants are this masked fat dude, and a nerd. The nerd charges at the fat dude, and trips, falling on his face, and just misses a punch from the fat dude. The nerd gets back up, and accidentally headbutts the fat dude in the face for a knockout. So, the nerd, #70, places. The announcer then calls the eight finalists over for the lottery.
 The fat dude, meanwhile, takes off his hood, revealing that he is Yajirobe. Yajirobe thinks that nerd was not just a clumsy bastard, then gets changed and leaves with his stuff. The announcer (who now has a little mustache) is prepared to start the lottery, and he screams when he sees Kuririn. The announcer starts praying, and so Kuririn tells him he is not a ghost, he was returned to life. With that aside, the numbers are drawn, and the announcer makes up a chart.
"
Tenshinhan vs. Taopaipai,169,"The cover shows Tien Shinhan, Goku, Krillin and Yamcha in facing towards Mercenary Tao, Chi-Chi, Piccolo and Hero respectively.
 Things are starting, and the three Kame dougi-wearing young men have told Bulma, Launch, Oolong, Puar, and Master Roshi that everyone but Chiaotzu is competing. Kuririn says the person who defeated Chaozu was Master Shen's little brother, Tao Pai Pai, who survived his fight with Goku and became half robot. Yamcha says Tao Pai Pai intends to kill Goku and Tenshinhan, and he is fighting Tenshinhan in the first match. Kame-sennin thinks Tenshinhan is in trouble, but Goku says he is not, Tao Pai Pai's no match for Tenshinhan.
 Tsuru-sennin interrupts them and says the clumsy punks of the Turtle School will be wiped out. Kame-sennin tells him that Tenshinhan, and now these three here, do not follow the Kame-Style, since they are walking their own path. ""Hoh, despite the fact that they are wearing Kame-Style dougi?"" Kame-sennin says they have done that against his will, and Kuririn affirms it. Then Tsuru-sennin walks off, talking some more crap about how they will lose. Goku says Tao Pai Pai is not really all that awesome.
 The contestants are called on to start the matches, and so everyone wishes Goku, Yamcha, and Kuririn well as they head off. Kame-sennin mentions getting to be a spectator this time, but then Oolong shouts out that the crowd is too big, and there is no way to get a good view. Bulma then tickles Launch's nose with a little reed, and she sneezes, turning into the bad one. Launch pulls out her pistols and starts firing into the air, clearing a path for them.
 Kuririn asks Goku why he thinks Tao Pai Pai would not win, and Goku explains that Tenshinhan is just much more awesome and, if Tsuru-sennin tries something, he has these things that can fill you up like ten days worth of food. Kuririn and Yamcha grin, and Kuririn says he and Yamcha also have Senzu Beans. Yamcha explains that Muten Roshi told him, Kuririn, Tenshinhan, and Chaozu about climbing Korin Tower, and so they all trained there. Kuririn says there was this Yajirobe dude there, and they told him to come to the World Martial Arts Tournament since he looked strong. But, it seems he did not show up. In fact, Yajirobe is hiding in the bushes, frustrated about having lost.
 ""Ladies and gentleman of the audience, so sorry to have kept you waiting such an awfully long time!! But now we are back, and we will begin the Twenty Third Tenkaichi Budoukai!!"" Tao Pai Pai and Tenshinhan are called out for the first match, and Lunch yells out at Tenshinhan to kick some ass. ""Well then, please begin the first match!!"" Tenshinhan and Tao Pai Pai stare each other down, as Yamcha, Goku, Kuririn, Tsuru-sennin, and Kame-sennin watch intently.
 Tao Pai Pai rushes at Tenshinhan, but Tenshinhan easily sidesteps it, and then pops Tao Pai Pai on the back. Tao Pai Pai staggers back up, frustrate, and Tenshinhan asks him to please stop. Tao Pai Pai asks about that, but Tenshinhan disappears and then reappears behind Tao Pai Pai, saying he thinks he has become too strong for him.
"
The Assassin's Struggle,170,"The cover shows Tien Shinhan with a bleeding wound on his right chest.
 Mercenary Tao is frustrated about Tenshinhan suddenly appearing behind him, and he is also frustrated about Tenshinhan saying he is too strong for him. Tenshinhan says it is not too hard not to tell, and Tao Pai Pai gets frustrated and comes at him. Tenshinhan easily dodges all of his strikes, then his kicks, and finally catches Tao Pai Pai's fist. Tenshinhan tells him he does not want to make Tao Pai Pai lose like this, since he and Master Shen taught him, and again asks him to please leave.
 Tao Pai Pai gets frustrated and jerks away, leaving his mechanical fist in Tenshinhan's hand. A Hidden Blade pops out of the socket where his hand was, and Tao Pai Pai slashes Tenshinhan across the chest with it. ""F-foul play!! That is foul play!! Use of weapons is firmly prohibited!! This contest's win belongs to Tenshinhan!!"" Tao Pai Pai does not care about that anymore; he just wants to kill Tenshinhan. Tsuru-sennin cheers him on, telling him to kill everyone else affiliated with the Turtle School as well.
 Tao fires his Super Dodon Wave Tenshinhan gets frustrated and takes off the rest of his shirt, and Tao Pai Pai pops off his other hand. Yamcha and Krillin volunteer to help, but Tenshinhan says he wants to do it himself. Tao Pai Pai's second hand is a gun which can fire a Super Dodon Wave He tells Tenshinhan to prepare to go to Hell. Tenshinhan stands unmoving, though, and Tao Pai Pai targets Tenshinhan with his cyborg radar vision.
 Tao Pai Pai then fires the tremendous Super Dodonpa at Tenshinhan, but Tenshinhan just screams, stopping the blast. Tao Pai Pai can not believe he has cancelled out the Super Dodonpa with just a kiai. Tenshinhan then runs over and punches Tao Pai Pai in the gut, knocking him out. Tenshinhan then picks him up and takes him over to Tsuru-sennin, saying he probably would not wake up for days. Then he asks them to please just leave, and so Tsuru-sennin flies off with Tao Pai Pai draped over his shoulders. And so, the second match is called to begin, and Goku wants to know why this girl is so mad at him once they get in the ring.
"
Goku Gets Married!,171,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku and Chi-Chi married driving in their wedding hovercar. A flashback based on this cover is shown in the Dragon Ball Z episode ""The Newest Super Saiyan"".
 Goku asks the girl if she is not mistaking him for someone else, but she says he is Son Goku, so it is no mistake. Everyone else wonders who she could be, as the announcer calls for the match to begin. The girl kicks at Goku, then strikes at him, but Goku dodges and asks if they have met somewhere before. The girl says they have, and then comes at him again. Goku blocks her punches as she goes on about not understanding a girl's feelings, and making her wait. The girl says that he has forgotten his promise while Goku jumps up to dodge her elbow. Goku can not believe he really made a promise to her. She jumps up in the air after him, throwing some kicks that Goku dodges. Master Roshi thinks her moves are like that of the Kame-sen Styles. Then they both come back down to the ring, and Goku asks what he promised her. ""To take me as your wife!!!""
 The girl is angry as Goku does not remember and Goku asks Krillin what a ""wife"" is. Kuririn and Yamcha fall over, and then Kuririn says taking a wife means to get married. Kuririn is jealous at Goku for getting such a cute girl, and he wants one himself. Yamcha explains that getting married means living together as man and wife, and can not believe Goku made a promise like that. Goku asks her just who she is, and she says she will tell him if he wins. Goku is glad it is something so easy.
 Goku hits Chi-Chi with his Shockwave Fist Oolong smirks and remarks about how Goku still does not know who she is, and says that, he, Bulma, Puar, and Muten Roshi were also there when Goku met her. Goku tells the girl to get ready, then he punches at her, not hitting her, but the shockwave sends her out of the ring. The announcer thinks nothing happened, but Kame-sennin explains to him that he merely blew her away with a shockwave.
 Goku tells the girl to get up, as Piccolo, who is standing atop the roof of the backstage house, says that was like one of the Demon Clan's techniques. The girl is impressed with her strong husband, and can not believe he still does not know. ""I am Ox-King's daughter, Chi-Chi!"" Goku, Yamcha, Kame-sennin, Bulma, and Puar all freak out, but Oolong already knew it was her. Goku remembers their conversation in the car at Fire Mountain, and thinks to himself how he thought a ""wife"" was something you eat. But a promise is a promise, so he tells Chi-Chi they will get married. The announcer tells everybody that Goku has proposed marriage. She grabs him by the arm and snuggles up next to him as they walk backstage, and he tells her not to get so close, it is hard to walk. Then Goku tells Kuririn to be careful, his opponent is not no small matter. So, Kuririn and Piccolo walk out to the ring, calling each other ""stuck up bastard"" and ""small fry"", respectively.
"
Kuririn vs. Demon Junior,172,"The cover of this chapter is Krilin throwing a kick in the foreground, and Piccolo standing in the background.
 The chapter begins just as the fight between Kuririn and Piccolo. Kuririn notices Piccolo's overconfidence in his power, and immediately warns him he will be fighting all out. Kuririn starts the battle by firing the Double Tsuihikidan at Piccolo. Piccolo easily dodges, flying in the air. Kuririn then bends the beams upward at Piccolo, however, Piccolo manages to blow up both beams from a safe distance with his Eye Lasers. As Piccolo was blowing up the Double Tsuihikidan with Eye Lasers. Kuririn uses that time to jump towards Piccolo, immediately punching him while Piccolo is distracted by the Double Tsuihikidan.
 Kuririn's Double Tsuihikidan Piccolo admits Kuririn is more impressive than he first thought and decides to get serious during their fight. The two fighters then partook in some close range combat, exchanging rapid punches. Then end result shows Piccolo with the upper hand as he kicks Kuririn far back. It seems the fight is over, as Piccolo kicked him a good enough distance to knock him out of bounds. But it is then seen that Kuririn mastered Buku-Jutsu. Goku and Ten Shinhan are amazed at Kuririn's progress.
 Piccolo once again admits he underestimated Kuririn, not for his Buku-Jutsu, but for his toughness and speed. Piccolo then deems Kuririn a worthy fighter to see ""A true demon's power."" Goku warns Kuririn not to underestimate Piccolo's power as he is not bluffing.

"Kuririn vs. Demon Junior, Part 2",173,"This cover features Goku standing in two different poses. In the first, Goku has his back turned towards you, and is looking back. In the second, Goku is happily flexing his muscles.
 Piccolo stretches his arm to grab Kuririn The fight between Piccolo and Kuririn continues. Piccolo has now begun to get serious, promising to show Kuririn a glimpse of his true power. Piccolo then stretches his arm and grabs Kuririn. Piccolo pulls him close to him at an amazing speed, then punches Kuririn in the face when he was close enough. The punch sent Kuririn flying back, but he had easily recovered, he landed after being knocked away by the punch and charged Piccolo again. Piccolo easily dodges a punch by Kuririn, then kicks him in the air. Kuririn decides he's going to have to finish this soon, so decides to use a good amount of his energy on the Kamehameha. As Piccolo charges, Kuririn fires the Kamehameha, but found out he fired it on the wrong Piccolo, as Piccolo used the Afterimage Technique. The real Piccolo then appears behind Kuririn, brutally punching him all the way back down into the arena. Kuririn gets up and realizes he is finished, so decides to quit the match.
"
Yamcha vs. Shen,174,"The cover of this chapter features Yamcha and Shen. Both are posed in fighting positions, Yamcha in the foreground and Shen in the background.
 Match number four begins, as Shen and Yamcha enter the ring! Immediately, Yamcha underestimates his opponent, Shen (Kami). Shen is underestimated due to his not intimidating, and very average look. When the match begins, Yamcha offers to let Shen make the first move, due to his overconfidence. Shen throws a punch, but it is far off, and greatly misses. However, the punch caused him to fall, and on his way down from falling he manages to kick Yamcha's ribs. This pains Yamcha, and also embarrasses him greatly. A very embarrassed Yamcha then decides he would like to end this battle as soon as possible. Yamcha charges at Shen, who then ducks out of fear. Yamcha misses, and jumps over Shen, due to his duck. When Shen stands up Yamcha is right above him, resulting in Shen headbutting Yamcha's crotch. This sends the fans of the Tournament into a wild laughter, as Yamcha is once again horribly embarrassed by Shen. Yamcha is extremely furious. Yamcha then tells Shen that this did not hurt, and that he has trained every inch of his body. Shen is relieved, he feels confident that he will win the match, and did not want things to end like that. After now knowing both fighters are extremely confident in their abilities to win the match, they decide to serious up. For themselves, and for the fans watching. Shen then states that he will take the next move, and then bolts at Yamcha, delivering a painful elbow to the face. This impact sends Yamcha flying and knocks him straight on his back. Yamcha then decides to step his game up and attack Shen. This easily shows that Shen has the advantage, blocking every punch and kick as if it were no problem, showing Yamcha his weak points, and giving him lessons as they fight each other. Everyone is beginning to wonder, just who this Shen guy is.
"
Shen,175,"The cover of this chapter is Yamcha throwing a kick in the foreground, and Kami and Shen in the background.
 Yamcha throws his new Sokidan technique This chapter is a continuation of the fight between Shen and Yamcha. Yamcha repeatedly charges Shen, throwing wild punches and kicks, but getting nowhere. Shen continuously blocking his hits, then punching Yamcha away. The crowd is in awe, wondering how such a plain, skinny, and clumsy man can make Yamcha look like a fool, due to the amazing performances he has shown in previous tournaments. Yamcha then throws a flying kick at Shen, to which he easily dodges, sneaks behind Yamcha, then throws a painful kick in the ribs. Yamcha is once again beaten to the ground by Shen. Yamcha decides he has had enough and, though he planned on using it later in the tournament, decides he needs his new technique to beat Shen. Yamcha charges a great amount of energy in his right hand, then fires his new technique, Spirit Ball. A technique where Yamcha throws a tiny ball of chi, where he can easily control its directions at high speeds. The move begins to worry Shen, just being able to outmaneuver Yamcha's technique. Yamcha then sends the ball underground, and when Shen begins to let his guard down, the Sokidan blasts its way through under ground and strike him in the face. Shen is knocked back a few steps at the incredible impact the Sokidan hit him with. Shen then decides the fight needs to end, quickly runs at Yamcha, and elbows him directly in the chest. The hit is so shocking and painful it sends Yamcha stepping backwards shaking, until he finally falls out of the arena. Yamcha admits defeat to the incredible Shen and asks just who he is. Shen winks at Goku and says he will find out soon enough.
"
Goku vs. Tenshinhan,176,"The cover is Goku and Tien Shinhan together in a friendly pose in the World Martial Arts Tournament arena.
 The World Tournament Announcer states it is finally time to begin to begin the semi-finals of the World Martial Arts Tournament. He also states there's never been fighters quite as strong as these four ever before, and Master Roshi adds the fact that they are most likely the strongest four people on the Earth.
 The first fight of the semi-finals features Goku fighting Tien Shinhan. The two promise each other to go all out from the start, absolutely no holding back. Everyone is excited to see this, curious of Goku's true strength. Piccolo also sees this as a great way to observe the fighters, and study their fighting styles.
 The two fighters flip into the arena and the match begins. The fight begins with the two clashing, Tien Shinhan's elbow clashing with Goku's knee. Tien then attempts his Machine Gun Punch technique on Goku, but he quickly evades, jumping into the air. Tien Shinhan still pursues Goku, attempting to hit him with a Ki Blasts, which Goku quickly deflects back to him, and Tien Shinhan smacks it to the ground. The two then collide in the air, rapidly throwing punches and kicks at each other, while slowly working their way to the ground. The two finally float back down to the arena, and land on different sides. Once again, they jump at each other, this time grabbing each other's hands. The two begin to struggle back and forth, neither having a big advantage in strength. Goku then quickly leans backwards, throwing Tien Shinhan off his balance, then kicking him in the air. Tien Shinhan then chases Goku, and throws a punch. It is then seen Tien Shinhan had not hit Goku, but instead punched an afterimage of Goku. Goku then taunts Tien Shinhan for falling for such an old trick. It is then seen that Tien Shinhan is out of breath, and Goku is perfectly fine. The fight continues in the next chapter.
"
"Goku vs. Tenshinhan, Part 2",177,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku and Tien Shinhan locked in a battle.
 Goku vs. Tenshinhan Tenshinhan is impressed with Goku's progress, but says he will win this match with speed. He comes at Goku and vanishes, and then Goku vanishes as well. They are up in the air, and Goku is frantically kicking at Ten. Ten then comes back into view and compliments Goku's eyes, and he asks what happens when he can not see him with his eyes. Tenshinhan then gets above Goku and elbows him down toward the ring. Goku lands safely and flips backwards, elbowing a Ten's afterimage. Goku prepares to move again, but then Ten comes back into view and kicks Goku out of the ring. Goku spins like a tornado back into the ring, and he compliments Tenshinhan's speed. Ten says with his speed, he is sure to win, and Goku asks for a minute to change his clothes.
 Goku pulls down his top, takes off his undershirt, and throws it to the ground with a big thud. Tenshinhan picks up his shirt and sees that it is really heavy. Goku explains that the weighted clothing are part of Kami's training. Even with Kame-Sennin he wore heavy Turtle Shells. Tenshinhan then sees that Goku's shoes and wrist guards are all heavy, too. Krillin and Yamcha come in the ring to take Goku's shoes and stuff backstage, and are surprised when they notice how heavy they are. Tenshinhan says altogether that stuff is more than a hundred kilograms, and the announcer and the audience are surprised too.
 Goku then jumps up and down, feeling light now, and so they will get back to the fight. Tenshinhan rushes at Goku, but Goku vanishes. Tenshinhan spots him and comes at him with an elbow, but Goku blocks it. They stop, and Tenshinhan says that Goku's speed is not much after all. But then, Goku shows he has Tenshinhan's obi (the sash he wears around his waist) and Tenshinhan's pants fall down.
"
Tenshinhan's Secret Move!,178,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku, Tien Shinhan, Krillin, Yamcha and Chiaotzu riding in a car. This cover art is also featured in Daizenshuu 1.
 Tenshinhan looks down and can not believe Goku has his obi. Even Piccolo, who is watching the battle from the top of a roof, remarks that Goku is fast. Tenshinhan says Goku went so fast even his own eyes could not see, however, he has not lost this match yet. He tells Goku about his great sure-to-kill technique, but Goku hands him back his obi first. Tenshinhan freaks out and pulls his pants back up, and Goku asks if this will be the Tri-Beam again. Tenshinhan says the Kikōhō is too dangerous, for the both of them.
 Tenshinhan says that the technique he is about to use does not take as much power as Kikōhō, either, and tells Goku it is also absolutely unavoidable. His three eyes are not enough to catch Goku's movements. However, with twelve eyes, nothing could escape his view. Tenshinhan folds his arms in front of himself, and then splits into two and then those two split, making a total of four Tenshinhans.
 Goku says this is not Afterimage Technique, all of them are real. They all four say this is Multi-Form, and then they split up with each standing in one corner of the ring. Goku wonders what he will do, and each of the four Tens fire Ki Blasts at Goku. Goku jumps up into the air, and so the Tens fire Mystery Ray up at him and they all hit. One of the Tens tells Goku he should give up, but Goku says he would not since he has already discovered two weak points in Ten's technique. Up on the roof, Piccolo thinks it is Goku's win for sure.
"
The Two Weak Points,179,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku in a fighting position. Next to him are four Tien Shinhans lined up in a row.
 Tenshinhan tells Goku that his next attack would give him the victory. The four Tens each get in a separate corner and again fire four Mystery Ray at Goku. Goku jumps up over them again, and a Ten yells out that he can not escape their twelve eyes. However, before the Tens can use their eye blasts again, Goku uses the Taiyō-Ken, blinding everyone except the sunglasses-wearing announcer and Master Roshi.
 Goku comes back down to the ring, and tells the Tens that their first weakness: their eyes are too good. They see an opponent's movements with just their eyes, so without them, they are no good. One of the Tens says it is the same with him, but Goku giggles and says it is not. Goku then says “The Ten behind me plans to hit me with a right chop,” and tells that during his training on the Lookout he learned how to not rely on his eyes to see his opponent.
 Goku then brings up the second weakness, saying that becoming four people was a mistake. Goku charges at one of the Tens, hitting him in the chest, then he runs around the ring hitting the second, third, and finally the fourth, and they all four are out of the ring. Goku says that since he divided into four people with one person's power, their attacks, defense, and speed would also be divided by four. So, now, Goku advances to the finals.
"
Kami-sama vs. the Demon King,180,"The cover of this chapter shows one side of each of Kami's and Piccolo Jr.'s face, put together to make a single face.
 Goku and Tenshinhan shake hands, and then head backstage. Chi-Chi compliments Goku once he gets back there, and Ten tells Yamcha and Krillin that he knows Goku still was not even using his true power. Piccolo thinks Goku is definitely worthy of being his destined rival, as the World Tournament Announcer calls on him and Shen for the sixth match to decide who will face Goku in the finals. In the backstage house, Shen prepares to go out there and Goku asks Chi-Chi to wait outside a minute.
 Shen tells Goku he has borrowed his human body, and Goku asks him if he came to defeat Piccolo. Shen tells Goku he can not defeat Piccolo, and then asks Goku if he had not heard from Mr. Popo about his connection to Piccolo. Goku says nothing, hinting at yes. Since he and Piccolo were once one person, if Goku kills Piccolo, he will also die. Shen is angry at Mr. Popo because said too much. Goku says Mr. Popo was just worried, and Shen says with Goku knowing that, he probably can not kill Piccolo, which is why he will have to do it himself. Goku says there must be something they can do besides killing him, but Shen says there is not. Since Piccolo Daimaō is a seed that he sowed, he wants to get rid of it himself.
 Out in the ring area, everyone wonders what is taking Shen so long, and Yamcha notices he is in talking with Goku. Shen tells Goku that even if he does die, he has already taught a human to take his place. And then Shen heads out to the ring, and tells Piccolo he was on the toilet, and Piccolo asks whether he would not run away. Krillin asks Goku what the two of them were talking about, and Goku says it was fighting stuff.
 The announcer calls for the match to begin. Piccolo tells Shen he is not his target, Goku is. Shen asks Piccolo whether he plans to get rid of Goku so he can take over the world again, and says he is the same as ever. Piccolo wonders how he knows that, and Shen creates a huge shockwave, blowing at Piccolo. Piccolo stops himself mid-air, and so Shen comes up after him. Piccolo fires a Ki Blast over at Shen, but Shen dodges it, and the blast crashes into the ocean surrounding Papaya Island. Piccolo then whacks Shen back down toward the ring from behind. Once Shen lands, Piccolo is behind him again and swipes at Shen, but Shen vanishes. Shen is above Piccolo, and he kicks him down below the ring. Piccolo comes up through the other side of the ring, and the two stare each other down as Krillin wonders what is happening to them.
"
God's Miscalculation,181,"The cover show Piccolo standing, still wearing his weighted clothing.
 Shen uses the Evil Containment Wave on Piccolo Shen thinks of how he is borrowing a weak human's body, and Piccolo asks aloud about borrowing a human's body. Shen says, in some weird language, that Piccolo can read minds, and then Piccolo says, in the same language, that he now knows who he really is. They keep talking in this language for a while. Piccolo asks what God wants here in the lower world, and Shen says he should not have to say, since it should be obvious.
 Piccolo laughs about him thinking he could beat him, Piccolo, and thinks God has lost his mind. If one dies, the other dies. Shen says he does not mind that, and Piccolo can not believe he would actually commit suicide. Shen says there is nothing to worry about, as he has taught a human to take his place. God and Piccolo stop talking in foreign language, and then God pulls a little bottle out of his shirt pocket and places it on the ground.
 Piccolo reverses the Evil Containment Wave Piccolo freaks out, as this bottle can obviously serve as a Denshi Jar, and Shen indeed announces a Evil Containment Wave. Magic waves begin to swirl toward Piccolo, but Piccolo smirks, and then announces his Reverse Mafuuba. The magical wave instead begins to swirl back towards Shen, and then God flies out of the human's body. God yells out to Goku to not worry about him dying, just rid the world of Piccolo. Then, Piccolo directs God into the little bottle, runs over, and plugs the top. Piccolo smirks and holds the bottle as everyone looks on in shock.
 
"
The Fated Showdown!,182,"The cover shows Goku confronting Piccolo at the 23rd Tenkaichi Budoukai.
 Piccolo laughs about having sealed away God, as the World Tournament Announcer counts down on Shen (the human body was left lying down face first once God flew out of it). ""...Nine...Ten!! He can't get up!!! Ma Junior has won with that mysterious technique!!! He's advanced to the finals!!"" Goku can not believe he has trapped God in that bottle, as the announcer goes over and wakes up Shen.
 Everyone claps for the nerd once Shen stands up, and he asks the announcer if he was just in a Tenkaichi Budoukai match. The nerd struts back into the audience, thinking he must have drank some sake, and is then complimented by his son on how strong he was. The announcer says there will be a ten-minute break before the grand finals kick off, and so Piccolo heads backstage, as does Master Roshi.
 Goku tells Piccolo to hand over that bottle once he gets back there, but naturally, Piccolo refuses. Instead, Piccolo swallows the bottle, and says he will have to kill him to get it out. Although, killing Piccolo would also kill God. Piccolo walks off, laughing about having the upper hand, and then Kame-sennin shows up.
 Kame-sennin asks Goku what is going on, and then Tien Shinhan also wants to know, that Piccolo is too strong to be an ordinary member of the Demon Clan. ""That guy... is King Piccolo..."" Tenshinhan can not believe that, since Piccolo should be gone, and Goku says he did defeat him. Chi-Chi then realizes Goku was the one who rid the world of Piccolo Daimao.
 The ultimate showdown at the 23rd Tenka'ichi Budōkai Goku relays what God had told him about Piccolo putting out an egg just before he died, and Piccolo was born from that egg. He is mostly the same as the previous Piccolo, except that he is far stronger. Yamcha and Tenshinhan bring up seeing Piccolo fly out of Shen's body when the Evil Containment Wave was used, and Goku says that person was not Piccolo. It was God borrowing a human's body in order to fight Piccolo.
 Goku then explains how God and Piccolo were once one person, and that the evil God expelled from himself turned into Piccolo. Therefore, if one is killed, the other dies as well. Everyone wonders what to do now, with Goku seeming to be the last resort, and then Piccolo interrupts them. He starts trash-talking, and says how great it will be in his Demon World once he wins.
 The announcer then calls Piccolo and Goku out for the finals, and Piccolo threatens Krillin on the way out. Goku heads out to the ring, and Kuririn's freaked out about how carefree he is with the fate of the world at stake. Piccolo asks Goku if he is prepared, and Goku asks for what. ""Prepared to die, of course!"" Piccolo has thrown off his mantle, and Bulma and Launch cheer Goku on. ""Please begin the finals of the Tenkaichi Budoukai!!!""
"
Testing the Waters,183,"The cover of this chapter shows Goku and Piccolo Jr. locked in a battle.
 Goku and Piccolo rush at each other, blocking each other's strikes, and then Piccolo headbutts Goku across the ring. Goku lands on his feet, though, and Piccolo flies over behind him. But, Goku kicks back at Piccolo, and then they break. Piccolo then stretches his arm out, but Goku catches it, and tosses Piccolo into the air by it.
 Piccolo sends a shockwave down at Goku, but Goku counters it and sends it back up at Piccolo somehow, knocking Piccolo backwards. Goku jumps up after him, as Piccolo slyly closes a fist. Then Piccolo opens the fist, firing a blast down at Goku, and sending Goku back down toward the ring. Then Piccolo fires a blast at him with his other hand, and then a whole bunch of blasts that all connect as Goku hits the ring.
 A huge hole is in the ring now, with Goku lying in the center. Piccolo yells at the World Tournament Announcer to stop counting, as Goku is faking. Goku easily gets back up, and is not hurt much. He notices his clothes are getting all tattered again, so he takes off the remains of his shirt. Goku and Piccolo decide to go full throttle now, and then rush at each other.
"
The Real Fight,184,"The cover shows Goku and Piccolo facing each other on the World Martial Arts Tournament ring, with Chi-Chi, Tien Shinhan, Master Roshi, Yamcha, and Krillin watching them. This chapter's cover is used as a scene in ""Detekoi Tobikiri Zenkai Power!"", the first ending for Dragon Ball Z.
 Goku and Piccolo come at each other, exchanging multiple fast hits, and then they clasp hands for a test of strength. Piccolo tries to fire Eye Lasers at Goku, but Goku ducks them, and then swings his feet up to kick Piccolo in the face, knocking him back a bit. Then Goku disappears, and Piccolo waits for it, then he elbows Goku into the back wall. The wall gets busted up, surprising Krillin and everyone who are right next to the wall.
 Goku is not in the rubble, but is behind Piccolo now, and he kicks Piccolo across the ring. Piccolo then heads up into the air, and yells down that he is going to blow the whole place away. Goku yells at everyone to run away, but then realizes it is too late for that. Goku jumps up after Piccolo, who thinks Goku is an idiot for protecting humans.
 Piccolo fires an Explosive Demon Wave down toward Goku, and it just barely grazes Goku before it lands in the distance and blows up some random mountains. Piccolo's angered it just merely grazed him, as Goku flies off toward a ring out. But Goku propels himself back into the ring with a little Kamehameha, and then yells up at still mid-air Piccolo that he is going to counter with a Super Kamehameha.
"
The Super Kamehameha,185,"The cover show Goku preparing a Super Kamehameha, with a frustrated Piccolo in background.
 Goku fires his Super Kamehameha Goku is charging a Super Kamehameha. Master Roshi then yells out at Goku to wait; if he kills Piccolo, Kami will also die. Goku then stops, and gets mad at not knowing what to do. Piccolo says he is going to wipe out everyone with this next attack, and make this world into a living Hell. Goku yells up at Piccolo, who is powering up, to not be a coward and come back down here and fight him. He also tells the others are not involved in their battle.
 Piccolo prepares to launch his attack, and everyone thinks it is over until Krillin yells out to Goku that they can revive God with the Dragon Balls so he can go ahead with the Super Kamehameha. Piccolo yells down that Shenron died three years ago, and he fires his Exploding Demon Wave down toward the ring. Goku yells up that Shenlong was revived and fires his Super Kamehameha.
 Goku's Super Kamehameha vs. Piccolo's Explosive Demon Wave Goku's Super Kamehameha flies up at Piccolo's Exploding Demon Wave, overpowers it, and then heads toward Piccolo. Piccolo shields himself. It is a direct hit, but Piccolo is still alive, although his clothes are pretty torn up.

Panic at the Tenkaichi Budokai!,186,"The cover shows a confident Piccolo in foreground, while many other characters are in background.
 Piccolo comes back down to the ring, as Goku's impressed that he took the Super Kamehameha so easily. The World Tournament Announcer, along with the rest of the audience, starts to notice something about Piccolo without his turban, and Launch mentions him now resembling King Piccolo. The rest of the audience bustles with agreement, until Piccolo shouts that he is the recantation of Piccolo Daimao.
 Giant Piccolo Piccolo goes on about his plans to take over the world again once Goku is dead. Everybody flee except for Oolong, Launch, Bulma, Puar, and the announcer who hop over the barricade and join them, continuing to call things. Goku tells Chi-Chi, Master Roshi, Krillin, Yamcha, and Tien Shinhan to all go join them, and so they leave from the back wall area over into the remains of the audience.
 Piccolo says they will love his next attack, and starts powering up for it. Suddenly, Piccolo starts to grow, and ends up about a Great Ape size. Piccolo punches down at Goku and then stomps down, but Goku just barely hops out of the way of both. Goku has jumped up to Piccolo's eye level, and so Piccolo swats him down to the ring, hitting hard. Tien offers to lend a hand, but Goku declines, since he wants to win the match without being disqualified.

Piccolo's Super Giantification Spell,187,"The cover shows Goku riding a motor bike with Chi-Chi. This cover art is also featured in Daizenshuu 1.
 Goku thinks Piccolo's large size is not so big, so Piccolo fires a Mouth Energy Wave down at him. Goku dodges it by running though Piccolo's legs, and then he jumps up and kicks the back of Piccolo's leg. Piccolo loses his balance and starts to fall down backwards, but he catches himself by placing his hands down on the ring. Goku then grabs one of his fingers, and slams the giant Piccolo overhead by it.
 Giant Piccolo faces Goku Master Roshi asks Krillin if he has noticed that even having used that tremendous Kamehameha, Goku's physical strength has not gone down at all. Piccolo gets back to his feet, and Goku yells up at him that even if he got much, much larger, he still would not be much trouble. Piccolo hints that he can get even bigger, and Goku can not believe it.
 Before, Goku reached Piccolo's ankles, but now he is barely level with Piccolo's toes. Piccolo laughs maniacally about his assured victory, but then Goku thinks Piccolo is right where he wants him. Goku jumps way up to Piccolo's face, then fires a Kamehameha out, projecting himself into Piccolo's mouth. Piccolo gags and chokes, and then finally spits Goku out. Goku then tosses the bottle with Kami in it over to Tien Shinhan and Tien Shinhan takes Kami out of the bottle.
 Giant Piccolo blows Goku"
Goku's Fight,188,"The cover shows Piccolo and Goku fighting.
 Kami wonders what has happened. Bulma screams that there are two King Piccolo when she sees Kami. Kami remembers his Evil Containment Wave got deflected, and Master Roshi explains that Goku freed him with a great plan. Piccolo shrinks back down to normal size, and then they rush at each other again, going too fast to see. Kami can not believe even his eyes can not see them.
 Goku uses a Feet Kamehameha Goku and Piccolo are up in the air now, exchanging blows, Piccolo then hits Goku with a series of quick strikes. Goku falls back down toward the ring, but then he comes back up by firing a Kamehameha down at the ground with his feet. It boosts him up into the air so that he can hit Piccolo in the face with both fists, and then both of them fall toward the ground.
 Piccolo blasts Goku with Antenna Beams, and Goku falls to the ring even more busted up. Piccolo flies back to the ring and rushes over at the weakened Goku to punch him. Before he hits, Kami runs into the ring and stands in Piccolo's way, catching his punch. Kami tells Goku the two of them will defeat him together, but Goku refuses, since he'll be disqualified if Kami helps him. Goku allows Piccolo to continue his attack and Piccolo then punches Goku into the back wall.

The Demon King's Final Gamble,189,"The cover shows both tired Piccolo and Goku.
 The VIZ English release of Volume 16 has a collection of title pages in the back, and the page showing this image is mislabeled as ""Piccolo's Super Giantification Spell.""
 Goku easily gets back up, and says Piccolo's punch was not all that effective. Kami tells Goku he will regret it if they do not, but Goku insists he would regret it more if he does. Tien Shinhan and Krillin agree, since Goku has already saved the world once.
 Piccolo regenerates his arm Piccolo yells that he has leveled up a lot since three years ago, and Goku says he has gotten just a little stronger than Piccolo's level. Piccolo then fires off a huge blast at Goku. Goku sidesteps it, but the blast comes after Goku, and so Goku flies into the air to avoid it. Piccolo laughs and says running away is pointless, since it will follow him wherever he goes.
 So, Goku comes back down to the ring and runs over in front of Piccolo. He quickly gets out of the away, and Piccolo takes his own blast head on. Piccolo's left arm is completely useless now, and Goku thinks he should just give in. Instead, though, Piccolo rips his arm off, and starts powering up, until a new arm grows out in its place. Piccolo starts to power up for something great, and Goku yells at everyone to hurry up and run away.
"
Piccolo Destroys Everything!,190,"The cover shows Piccolo powering up.
 Piccolo performs a Hyper Explosive Demon Wave Piccolo keeps powering up, and Goku thinks he has never felt a ki this incredible before. Goku yells at everyone to get on an airplane and leave the island, and everyone wonders what he plans on doing. Goku says he is going to withstand this as Piccolo continues his massive power up. As there is no time left for them to get away, Tien Shinhan fires a Kikoho at the ground, creating a big hole for everyone to hide in.
 Everyone runs in, except Kami who continues to watch the match, but Launch kicks him down to the hole. Goku charges up to withstand it and Piccolo finally unleashes an incredible Hyper Explosive Demon Wave, causing a huge explosion, and busting up the entire island. Papaya Island is but a wasteland now, with the tiles from the ring all gone. Piccolo thinks he has won, but Goku is still standing as well, hardly damaged, and everyone climbs out of the hole and cheers for him.
"
The 10 Count,191,"The cover shows Bulma, Kami, Master Roshi, Launch, Krillin, Goku, Piccolo, the World Tournament Announcer, Chi-Chi, Tien Shinhan, Yamcha, Oolong and Puar in boxes.
 Goku tells Piccolo that he is used up all of his ki with that, and so now the victory is Goku's. Goku then performs the Meteor Combination: he charges up a bit and rushes at Piccolo elbowing him in the face, and then also kicks him in the face, causing Piccolo to cough up some blood. Then Goku delivers a hard punch to the gut, and then flies up into the air. Goku fires a huge Kamehameha down at Piccolo, and it is a direct hit.
 Piccolo fires a Mouth Energy Wave Goku touches back down in the ring area, standing next to the big crater he made, with Piccolo down in the center. The World Tournament Announcer runs over to make the count, asking if Piccolo is dead. But he is obviously not, since Kami is still alive. Everyone thinks it is over, until Piccolo sits up at the count of nine, and fires a Mouth Energy Wave up at Goku, piercing through his shoulder.
"
The Last Gasp!,192,"The cover show a tired and badly injured Goku.
 Goku falls back clutching the hole in his shoulder, which is bleeding really bad, and Goku coughs up some blood, too. Piccolo gets back up, and stands over Goku. Piccolo shouts that he is going to attack him now, and so he steps down on Goku's chest. Tien Shinhan, Yamcha, Krillin and all run in to help, but Piccolo stops his advance by blasting them with some electricity, and busting up the ground in front of them.
 Goku gets back up, though, and he is glad Piccolo missed his vital areas. Piccolo punches at him, but Goku ducks it and punches Piccolo in the gut. Piccolo then kicks Goku, and they break, and they both stop to catch their breaths. Piccolo thinks it is only a matter of time before Goku bleeds to death, and then hits Goku with an elbow, knocking him down. Piccolo jumps over toward Goku, and comes down, landing on Goku's legs, breaking them. Piccolo says it is just like when his father fought him, all Goku has left is his left arm. But, this time it will be different.
 Piccolo fires a little blast down at Goku's left arm, injuring it so that now he is unable to use his limbs. Piccolo says there is only one attack left, and so he flies up into the air. Kami then tells Tien to kill him, so that Piccolo will also die. God yells at him to hurry, since Kami can not kill himself, and they need to save Goku. It will only be temporary, Shenron can revive him, and so Tien agrees to it. But then Goku tells them not to do that, and says he will win. Finally, Piccolo fires a blast down at Goku.
"
The Fate of the Strongest,193,"The cover shows Goku and Piccolo in two different boxes, with Piccolo charging towards the bloody Goku. Under the two boxes, are six smaller boxes with the other six finalists of the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament.
 Piccolo's Explosive Demon Wave blast keeps coming down at the immobile Goku. The blast hits the ground, and there was a large explosion. When the smoke clears, there is just a crater in the remains of the ring. The crater is completely empty, and Piccolo comes back down to the ground, celebrating Son Goku's death, thinking he has turned to dust.
 Goku headbutts Piccolo Jr. for the victory Goku's friends are sad, as Piccolo continues celebrating his victory. But then Krillin notices something, and asks Tien Shinhan what he sees with his great vision. Tien Shinhan spots something; it is Goku, up in the air, a ways off. Goku is flying toward Piccolo from behind him, and Tien Shinhan shouts out that it is Flight. Goku continues darting toward Piccolo, and finally connects with a headbutt to Piccolo's gut.
 Piccolo is thrown off a distance, coughing up blood, and then he and Goku each hit the ground. Goku asks the World Tournament Announcer if that is not a ring out for Piccolo, and the announcer looks over, seeing that it is indeed. Goku's friends begin to celebrate as they run over toward him, as he is laying all beaten up and bloody in what used to be the ring.
"
The Gift of the Dragon Balls,194,"The cover shows the Dragon Team in the appearance they had at the beginning of the series, sneaking through a box.
 Everyone continues rushing over to Goku, while Yajirobe digs his way up from the ground, now that it is safe to come out. Everyone stops celebrating and starts worrying, since Goku can barely move, but Yajirobe comes up to them, saying he has brought Senzu Beans. Yajirobe gives Goku one, and he springs back up, fully restored. Goku jumps up into the air.
 Not everyone is celebrating. Kami stands over the fallen Piccolo and prepares to finish him off, but then Goku flies down and stops him. God says he has to kill him, since he is still alive. But Goku says he will just beat him up when he does something bad again, plus God would also die if Piccolo dies. Tien Shinhan says that they will just revive God with Shenron, but Goku says God lied about that. If God, the creator of the Dragon Balls, dies, Shenron probably will as well, and the Dragon Balls will disappear.
 God becomes silent, and says that he is no longer fit for the position of God. But Master Roshi tells him that is not so, the world is at peace again, and Son Goku and everyone else would not be here if it was not for the Dragon Balls. This whole thing started because of just one Dragon Ball, and now the world is safe.
 Roshi tells it is not the final chapter of the manga and that the series will continue God tells Goku he has a great teacher, and Goku agrees, although he is a bit of a pervert. Then, God magically fully restores Goku's outfit, saying that the Kame marked dougi is the best. Goku calls out to Yajirobe to toss him another Senzu, so Yajirobe obliges, and Goku then feeds it to Piccolo, to everyone is horror. Piccolo gets back up, laughing at Goku's stupidity, and then flies away until the day they meet again, when he will get his revenge. Goku really hopes he will get stronger so they can fight again.
 Bulma thinks that Goku is really grown since she first met him in the mountains. Chi-Chi then runs over to Goku, hugging him and stuff, and Goku tells her not to get so close. Then God tells Goku he wants him to replace him as God, but Goku declines, since it would be too boring. Soon, Chiaotzu flies in, all bandaged up, and is glad to see that everyone is okay. God asks Goku again, but Goku just sticks his tongue out, and calls for Flying Nimbus. He and Chi-Chi hop on, and he says ""Everyone, bye bye!!! Let's meet up again!!!"" He and Chi-Chi zoom off on Kinto-Un, leaving everyone astonished.

The Mysterious Warrior From Space,195 (DBZ 1),"March 2003 (as part of 17 (DBZ Vol. 1)) The cover shows a close up shot of Raditz wearing a scouter.
 Raditz arrives on Earth (colored version) Five years have passed since Goku's victory at the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament. A mysterious pod lands on Earth, crashing into a farmer's field in Spinach Wasteland. The farmer drives over to the crater to inspect the pod, with a rifle in hand. A man in Battle Armor with long, black spiky hair exits the pod, and approaches the farmer. For some reason, he seems annoyed that there are still inhabitants on the planet. Using the scouter attached to his ear, he learns the farmer has a Power Level of 5, and remarks on the inferior strength of Earthlings. Feeling threatened, the farmer panics, and fires a bullet at the visitor, but the man catches it with ease, and flicks it back at the farmer, killing him instantly. The man's device beeps loudly, detecting a high power level. He flies off towards it, expecting to meet a so-called ""Kakarot"".
 He follows his scouter to a wasteland, and is disappointed to find Piccolo instead. Annoyed with his flippant nature, Piccolo attacks, firing his Explosive Demon Wave, but the mysterious man is unfazed, and begins preparing an attack of his own, stopping when his scouter detects another strong reading. He leaves Piccolo behind, who finds himself paralyzed with fear.
 The man flies towards the reading, pondering whether Kakarot has forgotten the ""pride of the Saiyan race"". In his speech bubble, an image of Goku as a baby is shown, revealing that Kakarot and Goku are one in the same.

""Kakarrot"" (カカロット, Kakarotto) is the second chapter of Dragon Ball Z and the one hundred ninety-sixth overall chapter of the Dragon Ball manga.
 March 2003 (in Viz vol. 1) The cover shows Raditz wearing a blue scouter (green in the Full Color release) with his tail wrapped around his waist, standing in front of a white background. The Raditz art on this cover is featured in Daizenshuu 1.
 Goku introduces Gohan “Hello! Been a while!” says Bulma, as she walks into Kame House with her new short, boyish haircut. Kame-Sen’nin, Umigame, and Kuririn are very happy to see her, and Bulma has a gift for Kame-Sen’nin. He wonders if the gift is letting him feel her breasts, and so she slugs him. He says it was a gag as always, but Bulma says he’s a pervert as always. Meanwhile, Goku is flying toward Kame House on Kinto-Un! Kuririn asks Bulma about Yamcha, and she yells something about him being stupid. Then Bulma asks about Lunch, and Kuririn says she went off chasing after Tenshinhan five years ago.
 As Goku approaches Kame House, he tells “someone” that this is Muten Rōshi’s house. Elsewhere, the alien says Kakarrot is moving really fast. Back at Kame House, Goku hops off of Kinto-Un still holding “someone” and shouts “Yahhou!” at the house. Kuririn recognize Goku’s voice, and elsewhere the alien says Kakarrot’s movement has stopped. And… Goku is holding a little boy in his arms. Bulma asks about the kid as she comes outside, and Kuririn asks Goku if he has a babysitting job. “It’s my kid.”
 Kame-Sen’nin, Kuririn, and Bulma all freak out, as Goku puts the kid down. He’s wearing a fancy little dress outfit, and a hat with the Four Star-Ball on it. He politely greets everyone with a “Good afternoon”, and Bulma returns it. Goku says he’s named Son Gohan, and Kame-Sen’nin notes that he’s named after Goku’s dead grandfather. Bulma bends down and asks Gohan how old he is, and he says he’s four. Bulma is surprised to see Goku’s son has such good manners.
 Raditz attacks Krillin with his tail And then Bulma notices Gohan has a tail, like Goku used to, and her and the others ask if anything weird has happened on the night of a full moon. Goku says they go to bed early at his house, and wonders why they’ve asked, but Kame-Sen’nin dismisses it as nothing. Kuririn asks if he’s strong like Goku, but Goku says Chi-Chi gets mad when he tries to train him. She says since there’s peace in the world, there’s no use for martial arts, and it’s time for studying instead. Bulma then asks about the Dragon Ball on Gohan’s hat, and Goku says it’s Grandpa’s memento, the Four Star-Ball. He also has the Three Star-Ball and the Six Star-Ball.
 Goku suddenly gets very serious, because he feels an awesome power headed their way. The alien then touches down on Kame-Sen’nin’s island, and says he recognizes Kakarrot even all grown up, he’s the splitting image of his father. The alien goes on about how Kakarrot should’ve wiped out all of the humans on this planet by now, and wonders what’s up. Kuririn goes up to the alien, thinking he’s drunk, in the middle of the afternoon even, and Goku yells not to get so close. But it’s too late. The alien whacks Kuririn through the house with his… tail! Everyone is shocked to see the alien’s tail, which had been wrapped around his waist like a belt.
"
Tails of Future Not-Quite-Past,197 (DBZ 3),"March 2003 The cover shows Gohan smiling, wearing a hat with a Dragon Ball on the top. The text translates as ""My name is Gohan. I'm four years old. When I grow up, I want to be a great scholar."" For the Viz Media English translation, the following chapter's title page is used for this chapter instead. However, the VizBig edition includes the original title page, translated into English.
 Raditz abducts Gohan The alien is surprised to learn that ""Kakarot"" doesn't recognize him, and asks if he forgot his mission. Goku doesn't understand, and denies being Kakarot. The alien asks if Goku ever suffered a blow to the head that may have resulted in memory loss. Goku hazily recalls and confirms the event. Master Roshi tells of a conversation he had with Son Gohan, where the latter mentioned taking in a violent and aggressive child, who, after falling down a ravine, became good-natured, and calm. Goku realizes the child was himself.
 Realizing Goku has forgotten everything, the alien reveals that he is Goku's older brother, Raditz, that they were born on Planet Vegeta, and are both members of the warrior race, the Saiyans. Raditz further claims that Goku was sent here as a child to wipe out all life on the planet with the help of the moon, so that the Saiyans could resell it to a new species. Master Roshi, Bulma, and Krillin all realize what he means, but Goku doesn't know of his Great Ape transformation.
 Raditz becomes angry after noticing Goku's missing tail, and accuses him of trying to blend in with the humans he was supposed to kill. Confused, Goku denies his Saiyan heritage, and tells Raditz to leave. Raditz explains that there are only four Saiyans left alive after a meteor collided with their home planet, and asks Goku to join them to assist in conquering a difficult planet. Goku refuses. Raditz notices Gohan's tail, and realizes he's Goku's son. Raditz forcefully abducts Gohan, and demands 100 corpses be lined up on the beach of Kame House by the next day, or else he will kill Goku's son.
"
An Enemy in Common,198 (DBZ 4),"The cover shows a close up of Raditz with Goku and Piccolo shown behind him. This version of the title page is included in the Vizbig release.
 Raditz repeats his request to Goku to kill a hundred Earthlings, and if he doesn’t, he’ll kill his son. Goku can barely move, and Kuririn calls Raditz a coward. Raditz says this planet is the next target and reiterates about the hundred humans, but Goku weakly asks him to return his kid again. Unbeknownst to everyone Piccolo is watching on, pissed, from the back of the house. Then Raditz takes off, saying tomorrow will be fun, as Gohan cries for his father, and Goku lies on the beach unable to do anything.
 Goku and Piccolo leave Kame House to face Raditz Goku curses the situation, then calls for Kinto-Un. But Kuririn and Kame-Sen’nin object, asking if he really thinks he can win. Goku weakly stands and says that guy’s tail is his weak point; he will lose all his strength. But, Goku doesn’t think he can do it alone. Kuririn and Kame-Sen’nin volunteer to fight, but Goku says that God told him Shenlong can’t grant the same wish twice. In other words, if they die again, they’ll stay dead. Goku asks if they’ll help anyway, and they agree to. Kuririn thinks to himself how he’d wanted to get married. Bulma then suggests they use the Dragon Balls to get rid of Raditz, but Kame-Sen’nin doubts they could gather all of them in one day. Then Goku asks Bulma if she has the Dragon Radar, and she remembers that Gohan had a Dragon Ball on his hat as she gets it out. Raditz is moving at incredible speed, until he finally stops. Thankfully, he didn’t go back out into outer space. They prepare to head off, when Piccolo shows himself.
 Goku asks what he’s doing here, as Bulma crawls away in horror. Piccolo explains that he’s already met that guy, and that those two (Kuririn and Kame-Sen’nin) are no good. The way to beat him is for the two of them to team up — Son Goku and Piccolo Daimaō. Goku asks Piccolo if he’s suddenly had a change of heart, but Piccolo explains that this guy is in the way of his plans for world domination. So, they agree to work together, for now. Goku asks Bulma for the Dragon Radar, then he hops on Kinto-Un and asks Piccolo if he’ll be able to keep up. Then the two of them zoom off, and Kame-Sen’nin thinks those two just might be able to win. He asks Bulma if she remembers the location the radar had put out, so they can go as well.
"
An Unexpected Strength,199 (DBZ 5),"The cover shows Goku, Chi-Chi, Ox-King and Gohan all riding in a car. This image is used as a scene in ""Detekoi Tobikiri Zenkai Power!"", the first ending for Dragon Ball Z.
 Piccolo and Goku prepare to fight Raditz Goku and Piccolo continue heading toward Gohan and Raditz, and it’s a little more to the right. Meanwhile, at the crater, Raditz gets pissed at the crying brat, and locks Gohan up in his ship. Raditz prepares to go get some food, when his eye device beeps and picks up a battle power of 710 somewhere nearby. From his ship, in fact, and Raditz refuses to believe the brat is that strong, and thinks it’s broken.
 Goku says they’re getting close, and they should slowly come down, but Piccolo explains he has some sort of strange device that senses the enemy’s position and strength. So, they decide to instead come in from the east. Then Raditz gets a 710 on his eye device again, and he decides it’s malfunctioning. But then there’s another reading coming from the other direction. No, two readings. 322 and 334. One of those is the same battle power as Kakarrot. But, Kakarrot couldn’t possibly know where to find him, so this thing must definitely be malfunctioning.
 Then Raditz spots Goku and Piccolo flying in, meaning his eye device wasn’t malfunctioning after all, and the brat really does have a battle power of 710. Goku and Piccolo touch down, and Raditz wants to know how they found him. But Goku dismisses the question, then says he wants his son back. Raditz asks if he really intends to go against his older brother, and Goku says he ain’t his older brother.
 Piccolo gets tired of all the chitchat, and he throws off his turban and mantle. Goku notices that he has also been training with weighted clothing. Piccolo likes having all this weight off of his shoulders, and Raditz now gets a reading of 408 from him. Goku also takes off his undershirt, shoes, and wristbands, and his battle power goes up to 416. Raditz laughs and says they’re still nothing, and then yells, “Die!!!!” Goku and Piccolo prepare themselves, and Raditz runs at them, and instantly ends up behind them and elbows them each in the back. Goku and Piccolo each jump aside, shocked at Raditz’s speed, and Goku again thinks about grabbing his tail. Raditz then decides to tell them something good before they die: the other two surviving Saiyans have much greater battle powers than his own.
"
Nothing Up My Sleeve...,200 (DBZ 6),"The cover of this chapter shows Goku and Gohan riding a motorcycle. This images is re-used for the special postcard included with the first Dragon Ball Full Color Saiyan Saga volume.
 Piccolo and Goku fight Raditz Piccolo and Goku each think about how strong these Saiyans are, and Goku’s pretty excited about fighting such a strong opponent. Goku asks where his son is, and Raditz says he’s in the hole behind them. He put the brat in there because he was so noisy. Goku flies up and looks down into the crater, and tells Gohan to sit tight, Daddy’ll save him. Raditz smugly laughs and says they’ll die before that happens, and then Goku and Piccolo rush at him, repeatedly striking. They each get behind him, but Raditz back kicks both of them, then flies forward.
 Goku and Piccolo each charge after him, but Raditz gets in the air above them, so they follow him into the sky. Raditz then fires a blast from each hand down towards the two of them, and both Goku and Piccolo just barely manage to dodge them. Well, Piccolo’s left arm doesn’t exactly get away scot-free. Goku lands, but Raditz appears behind him and kicks him in the back, sending him flying. Raditz is not impressed at all, and Goku asks Piccolo if he’s okay. He notices Piccolo’s left arm is now nothing but a bloody stump, and Piccolo starts talking about a new technique he’s been working on.
"
Piccolo's Farewell to Arms!?,201 (DBZ 7),"The cover of this chapter shows Goku, Raditz, and Piccolo, who has two fingers extended to his forehead to charge the Special Beam Cannon.
 Piccolo firing his Special Beam Cannon (Full Color Manga) While losing to Raditz, Piccolo devises an idea which he tells to Goku. Unaware of what they are talking about, Raditz assures them it will not work. Piccolo tells Goku of a technique that, ironically, he had been saving to use against Goku, the Special Beam Cannon. The downside to the technique is that it requires time to build up, so Goku takes on Raditz to distract him. While fighting Goku, Raditz is suddenly surprised to see Piccolo's Power Level climb.
 Goku fires a Bending Kamehameha at Raditz, who dodges. Goku then bends it towards Raditz, although he catches it, much to Goku's surprise. Raditz retaliates by firing a Saturday Crush, which causes Goku to fall to the ground. As Raditz flies towards Goku for the final blow, Piccolo finishes charging his attack. Raditz's scouter suddenly reads Piccolo's Power Level and Raditz stops in shock. The chapter ends with Piccolo firing his Special Beam Cannon towards Raditz.
"
A Surprise Appearance,202 (DBZ 8),"The cover of this chapter shows Raditz with damaged Battle Armor.
 Piccolo firing his Special Beam Cannon As Raditz sweeps in towards Goku to deal the death blow, he suddenly stops. Piccolo has finished charging the Special Beam Cannon and he fires it at Raditz. As the confusion after the attack clears, it is revealed Raditz has dodged the beam, albeit with a piece of shoulder plating damaged and a shoulder wound. Piccolo is stunned, and Raditz grins, commenting that the attack would have killed him had it hit him head-on.
 Gohan breaking out of Raditz's Attack Ball As it seems all hope is lost, Goku suddenly grabs Raditz's tail, immobilizing him. He then tells Piccolo to use the Special Beam Cannon again, and Piccolo complies, recharging the attack. Raditz then starts cowardly begging to be released. Goku resists at first, and Piccolo hollers at Goku to not listen to him. However, Raditz's pleas take effect, and his tail slips from his younger brother's grasp. Seizing the moment, Raditz elbows Goku, knocking him back.
 Without mercy, Raditz lands his foot on Goku's chest, pinning him down. With Raditz free to move, Piccolo knows his attack will fail. All hope seems lost yet again, and the chapter ends with Gohan bursting from Raditz's space pod.
"
"Sayonara, Goku",203 (DBZ 9),"The cover of this chapter shows Goku riding a race car. It has markings on it that say things such as ""Capsule Corp."", ""53"", and ""Bird Studio"".
 Gohan's rage pushes his power level to 1307 Gohan busts up out of the space ship, really pissed, and has tears streaming down his face. Goku yells at him to run away, while Raditz freaks out that his eye device is getting a 1307 from the brat. “Leave My Daddy Alone!!!!!” Gohan then flies at Raditz and head butts him in the chest, cracking his armor. Gohan then returns to normal as Raditz is left reeling, and walks over to Goku, who once again tells him to run away. Raditz says now Gohan’s battle power has gone down to just 1, and he smacks Gohan away.
 He prepares to go finish off Gohan, and Goku pleads against it. But Raditz ignores him and walks off. Goku then jumps up and gets behind Raditz, locking him in a Full Nelson position. “Pi-Piccolo, hurry up and use that technique…!!” Raditz says he can’t do much to break free because of the brat’s attack from before. He yells at Kakarrot to let go, or else they’ll both die, but Goku isn’t concerned with that. Piccolo is more than happy to kill Son Goku along with him, and thinks of how his friends will probably wish him back with the Dragon Balls. Raditz tries to plead with Goku about how he was bad and he’ll leave again, but Goku won’t fall for it this time. “Makankōsappō!!!” Piccolo then fires the Makankōsappō straight through both Raditz and Goku.
"
The Needs of the Many,204 (DBZ 10),"The cover of this chapter is Goku standing in a plain white area, with only his shadow showing, looking back and waving.
 Raditz and Goku fall to the ground after being hit by Piccolo's Special Beam Cannon The blast sharply pierces through the chest of Raditz, and comes out through Goku’s back. Then the two of them fall to the ground with huge bloody holes in their chests. Raditz can’t believe Kakarrot sacrificed his life, and Piccolo begins to explain that he can just be revived with the Dragon Balls. Raditz starts laughing and says that everything up until now has been broadcast to his two comrades way out in space. They’ll come here and clear out all the humans, and maybe wish him back while they’re at it. Goku asks how long until those two come here, and Raditz says one year. Raditz keeps going on about how bad it’ll be when they arrive, and Piccolo finally gets fed up and finishes him off. Kame-Sen’nin, Bulma, and Kuririn are flying in a plane, and then Kuririn spots some people below them. They notice the only one standing is Piccolo, and wonder what’s happened.
 Piccolo finishes Raditz Meanwhile, far-off in space… Some bald mustached alien with another eye device says that Raditz is dead now. There’s also a little alien with an eye device, and wild hair sticking straight up like a treasure troll doll. Both are wearing armor in the same style as Raditz’s. The little alien chews on the arm of an alien he just killed, and the big alien asks what they should do. The little alien thinks about these Dragon Ball things that can grant whatever wish you desire, and the big alien asks if he wants to revive Raditz. The little alien thinks that would be a waste, and says he wants eternal life.
 Nappa and Vegeta Then they both blast off in space pods just like Raditz’s, and talk about how high Kakarrot’s kid’s battle power was. The little alien figures it may be due to the mixing of Saiyan and Earthling blood. The big alien says something about him being a Super Saiyan, and things if they breed with the Earthlings they could reestablish a stronger Saiyan empire. But the small alien thinks they should just kill everyone because it would be a bad idea to have a bunch of brats stronger than them running around. Back on Earth, Piccolo has explained the events, as Kuririn stands over Goku, and Bulma tends to Gohan. Goku then softly passes away, and his body just disappears! Piccolo says that bastard God must have done it, and thinks he probably has some plan for Goku. And the two other Saiyans decide to hibernate for the long journey to Earth…

A Warrior in Hell,205 (DBZ 11),"The cover of this chapter shows Goku riding a motorcycle. A halo can be seen above his head. This cover art is also featured in Daizenshuu 1.
 Piccolo takes Gohan for martial arts training Bulma asks about God taking Son-kun’s body, and Kame-Sen’nin thinks it’s a relief that it was God. Kuririn looks at Gohan’s Four Star-Ball hat, and says they must gather the other six to return Goku to life. Then Bulma gets pissed and wonders where Yamcha and everyone else are, and then wonders how Goku’s older brother knew their location. Piccolo tells them about the strange device he wears on his face that seems to detect an enemy’s strength and location. Bulma creeps over to Raditz and tells Kuririn to get it. Bulma then puts it on, and thinks it’s broken or something. She thinks if she takes it home and fools around with it, they can use it to find Yamcha and Tenshinhan. Kame-Sen’nin says they should first go back to Kame House, and Kuririn says he’ll go search for the Dragon Balls right afterwards.
 Kame-Sen’nin asks Piccolo what he plans to do, and Piccolo answers him by re-growing his missing arm, and everyone freaks out. Piccolo tells them to search for the Dragon Balls while God does whatever with Goku. And he’ll take in Son Goku’s son. Kuririn thinks he plans to eat the kid, and Piccolo freaks out. He explains that this Gohan brat has a lot of fighting potential, and he wants to bring it out before the other two Saiyans get here. Kame-Sen’nin is worried about his parents not knowing, but Piccolo insists there’s no time for that, and threatens to kill them. He’ll bring the brat back to their house after a year. He thinks it’ll be fun for Son Goku to hear about this and have to wait for his kid after they revive him. Kuririn is scared of how mad Goku and Chi-Chi will be.
 Goku and Kami stand in judgement before King Yemma Meanwhile, in the afterlife… There’s a grand station with a bunch of houses sitting in the clouds, and a long, thin path leading into the first building with a “WELL COME” sign on it. A bunch of souls are going down the path into the first building, and a little oni with a megaphone is directing them. Inside, God is at the front desk with Goku (whose clothes are no longer tattered, and he has a halo over his head). The desk is huge, with a giant with a beard and horns on his hat sitting at it. The giant is Enma-daiō, and God is explaining to him that he wishes for Goku to receive training from someone named Kaiō. Enma-daiō looks through his record book, and says that Goku has accomplished quite a lot. Then he asks if he really wants to brave the perils of Serpent Road to meet up with Kaiō instead of just going to Heaven, and God affirms it. Goku asks if everyone comes here when they’re dead, even aliens, and God explains that everyone in the universe comes here to be judged.
 King Yemma scolds Kami Goku asks if someone named Raditz came by before him, and God yells at him for not speaking politely. Enma-daiō says he sent him to Hell. Raditz struggled, but he took him down. Goku’s impressed, and tells God he wants to receive training from this guy instead. God says not to be so loud, and then whispers that Kaiō is actually stronger than Enma-daiō. Enma-daiō hears this, and wonders if he shouldn’t send God to Hell when his time comes. God tries to cover his tracks with some joke about Hell ears, and then Enma-daiō finally gives Goku the okay to go train with Kaiō. Enma-daiō points Goku in the right direction, and so he heads out to the Serpent Road, and says thanks. Then God begins solemnly thinking about the approaching danger, until Enma-daiō yells at him to shut up and hurry and go home. Meanwhile, an oni drives Goku out of the big checkout station, until they come to a serpent’s head. The oni asks Goku if he’s healthy, and Goku says he’s not because he’s dead. Goku asks about this Kaiō, and the oni explains that he’s a god who stands atop the whole universe. But now they’ve arrived at the serpent’s head, and Goku needs to climb up and walk all the way down the serpent’s back, Serpent Road, to reach Kaiō. Goku thinks it looks really long, and the oni tells him it’s a million kilometers.
 Goku can’t believe this, and the oni warns him not to fall through the clouds surrounding the road — below them is Hell. Goku wishes he’d brought a bentō, and the oni explains that he doesn’t need food, since he’s dead. Goku then asks the oni if he knows Uranai Baba, and he does. So, Goku says to tell her next time she comes by to tell Kame-Sen’nin Grandpa not to wish him back until a year from now. The oni makes a note of this, and then Goku takes off with Bukūjutsu. Elsewhere, in a capsule plane, Kame-Sen’nin says they can’t keep this quiet from Chi-Chi, and tells Kuririn to go tell her. Bulma says that she seems like an educational mama, so she’ll probably kill him. Meanwhile, Goku has decided that Bukūjutsu takes too much energy and is now running along Serpent Road.

Gohan and Piccolo,206 (DBZ 12),"The cover of this chapter shows scenes of Piccolo and Gohan in the top panel, Goku running down Snake Way in the middle down panel, and Krillin, Master Roshi and Bulma riding in a plane in the bottom panel.
 Piccolo hurls Gohan towards a mountain Piccolo brings Gohan to a shallow lake somewhere, and wants him to wake up. He’s been sleeping since Raditz knocked him out, and so Piccolo drops him in and gives him a rude awakening. Piccolo explains that he has something to tell him, and then Gohan gets scared and runs around crying for his father. Piccolo yells at him to shut up or he’ll break his neck. Then he calmly says to listen. “First of all, your dad is dead! He sacrificed himself in order to defeat that man.” Gohan then begins crying, and Piccolo insists he really will break his neck.
 Piccolo explains that Goku’s friends will use those Dragon Ball things to return him to life soon, but that’s not the problem. Two more bad guys even worse than the last one are coming to attack the Earth in one year. Even if Son Goku returns to life, the two of them won’t be enough. “We need your power!!” And so he’s going to train Gohan to protect the Earth. Gohan insists that he can’t fight, but Piccolo insists he has a lot of hidden power, and he plans to bring it out. Piccolo decides to prove it by grabbing Gohan by the head and throwing him at a nearby mountain! At first, Gohan is scared as he flies toward it, but then, somehow or other, he gets mad and charges up to unleash a blast that completely obliterates the mountain.
 Goku runs on Snake Way Gohan can’t believe he really did that, and Piccolo explains about his true hidden power coming out when he gets high strung, but he can’t win battles like that. Gohan doesn’t want to become a martial artist, he wants to be a great scholar, though. Piccolo says that’s all fine and dandy, as long as he defeats the two Saiyans coming in a year who plan to wipe out all the Earthlings. Gohan says he’s scared, and Piccolo threatens to kill him. “There’s no time, so we’ll begin right now!!! Take off your jacket!!!” Gohan says he wants to train under his father when he comes back to life, and Piccolo laughs and insults Goku. Goku then sneezes as he continues along Serpent Road.

"Son Gohan, the Inconsolable",207 (DBZ 13),"The cover of this chapter shows Gohan wearing an outfit similar to that of the Monkey King from Journey to the West and holding Nyoibō. This image is used as a scene in ""Detekoi Tobikiri Zenkai Power!"", the first ending for Dragon Ball Z.
 Gohan is chased by a dinosaur Gohan is worried if the training will be good, and Piccolo tells him the first part will be survival training. He’s going to leave Gohan here by himself to rough it for six months. Then they’ll get to the fighting. Gohan freaks out and says he’ll die all alone, and Piccolo says he’ll have bloodthirsty beasts to keep him company. Gohan gets scared, and Piccolo explains that it will all make him tougher, able to face spiritual and physical challenges.
 “Don’t forget that the key to the fate of the world is in your grasp. Believe in your own power, and the effectiveness of that power. You must study to bring it out.” Piccolo then bids farewell, and tells him not to even think of running away — this is Heaven compared to the surrounding area. Gohan then cries and asks where the food, bathroom, and bed are, and Piccolo just laughs at this. Gohan thinks he’s cruel, and Piccolo tells him it’s his fate to be cruel, just like him.
 Kami tells Mr. Popo about Piccolo's change of heart Meanwhile, God is thinking about this Piccolo seeming different, and Mister Popo agrees that the old Piccolo Daimaō wouldn’t be making Son Goku’s son strong. And then God explains that Raditz went on to the afterlife, and normally, those killed by the Demon Tribe can’t move on. So he must be different from the old Piccolo. God seems to think Piccolo will be killed in one year when the two Saiyans come, which means he’ll also die. God thinks Piccolo may be trying to leave something behind after he’s gone, even if it is Son Goku’s son. Mister Popo mentions the Dragon Balls, and God says the next time will be the last time they’re used.
 Gohan is out in the wilderness, scared and crying. And then to make things worse, a dinosaur shows up, and Gohan quickly runs away from it… until he trips and falls. The dinosaur chomps down at him, but Gohan jumps up out of the way. The dinosaur looks around, and can’t find him because Gohan is now atop a nearby mountain far above the dinosaur. Gohan then cries about being trapped up there, all the way until nightfall, when he’s just lying down sniffling. He then spots a few apples, and excitedly eats them. But there’s no apple trees up here… And the apples are sour. Gohan cries about wanting Chinese food, and Piccolo, who’s watching from afar, gets pissed. Meanwhile, Goku continues hopping along Serpent Road.
"
Deeds Done by the Full Moon,208 (DBZ 14),"The cover shows Piccolo, Gohan on the mountain, and Gohan as a Great Ape in the background.
 Gohan transforms into an Ōzaru at the sight of the full moon There’s a full moon out, and Gohan is sleeping atop a mountain. Piccolo is also sleeping, while sitting cross legged, and floating mid-air. Gohan then wakes up to take a piss, and worries about how he’ll eventually get down from here. Then he wonders why it’s so bright out at night, and turns around and looks at the moon. This is his first time seeing a full one. And then he gets the look in his eyes like Goku used to, and begins transforming… Ōzaru Gohan is too big to stand atop the mountain, and so he falls to the ground.
 Piccolo freaks out as Gohan starts smash everything around him and fires a huge mouth blast off into the distance. He thinks the Earth will be destroyed before the Saiyans even get here, and then remembers what Raditz said to Goku about full moon transformations, and so he decides to take out the moon (one source claims via an illusion). Gohan then returns to normal, and falls asleep naked on the ground. Piccolo starts thinking about the strength of these Saiyans, and then realizes the tails are also needed for transformation.
 So, Piccolo pulls the tail off, and then decides to make Gohan a sword, and an outfit just like his father’s. Well, with the ma (“Demon”) kanji instead of kame (“Turtle”). In six months he’ll get special Hell training from Piccolo. He’s going to make him into one of the Demon Tribe. Then he flies off and leaves Gohan to sleep peacefully, while Goku is also sleeping peacefully on Serpent Road.

Goku and Gohan's Training Begins!!,209 (DBZ 15),"The cover of this chapter shows Master Roshi and Krillin riding in a car that says ""KAMEHOUSE"" on the side. A motorcycle with the word ""Capsule"" is tied down on the back of the car.
 Gohan easily evades the dinosaur Chi-Chi and Gyūmaō are speeding over the ocean in an air car, on their way to Kame House. Chi-Chi is pissed about Gohan being gone all night and not getting his studying done, while Gyūmaō is trying to calm her down. At Kame House, Bulma is in her bathrobe, and it seems she’s been working with Raditz’s eye device all night. And now she’s finally got it beeping. But Kame-Sen’nin, Umigame, and Kuririn are all crashed out, so she fires a machine gun to wake them up. First she tells Kame-Sen’nin to stand up, and she gets a reading of 139 for him. Bulma says she’s revealed the number expressing the strength of Muten Rōshi.
 Kuririn wants a turn now, and so Bulma tells him he has a battle power of 206! Kuririn’s excited to have passed Muten Rōshi, and Kame-Sen’nin thinks it must be broken. She can find all the strong powers in the world with this, and then suddenly finds a 250 about three thousand kilometers away. Kuririn thinks it must be Tenshinhan, and then Bulma gets a 177 in another direction. Kame-Sen’nin says it’s Yamcha. And then she gets a 329, which Kame-Sen’nin says is Piccolo. And Bulma notes that Gohan is with him. Kuririn asks if they shouldn’t go help him, but Kame-Sen’nin says no; they probably couldn’t help anyway.
 Ox-King and Chi-Chi learn of Gohan's abduction Bulma says they can still use this to get Yamcha and everyone to help gather the Dragon Balls, and return Goku to life in no time. But then Yajirobe shows up at their doorstep and starts yelling, “Hey!!” Kuririn goes out to see who’s making all that racket and recognizes him as the guy from Karin’s place, calling him Armadillo. “It’s Yajirobe, dumbass!!”
 Yajirobe has a message from Karin. “He said for you, Yamcha, Ten-whatever, and Chiaotzu to all come immediately!” Kuririn asks why everyone needs to go to Karin Tower, and Yajirobe explains that they’ll all be getting training from God, even him too. Kuririn’s amazed, and Yajirobe says he doesn’t really want to fight the strong aliens, but he has no choice. Yajirobe prepares to leave, but then remembers to tell them not to wish Goku back to life. Uranai Baba said he’s training in the afterlife. He speeds off, and everyone wonders about the stuff he’s just told them.
 They see another air car coming by, but this one is different. Kame-Sen’nin freaks out when they notice it’s Chi-Chi. Gyūmaō bows down before Muten Rōshi, and then Chi-Chi wants to know where Goku and Gohan are. “Uh…the truth is…” Sometime passes, and then Chi-Chi freaks out when she hears Gohan was taken by Piccolo Daimaō. Gyūmaō asks why Goku didn’t do anything, and Kame-Sen’nin says he’s dead. Chi-Chi then faints.
 Gohan cooks meat sliced from the dinosaur, showing that he has mastered basic ki manipulation “Soon, six months has passed, and Yamcha, Tenshinhan, Chiaotzu, Kuririn, and Yajirobe have all received stern training from God every day. And even after six months now, Son Goku is still running toward Kaiō’s house. Will he ever arrive? And Son Gohan… has gotten stronger and been able to survive.” That dinosaur from before shows up, and Gohan is able to run away with no problem. He jumps up out of the way, and the dinosaur crashes into a mountain. The end of the dinosaur’s tail is missing, and then Gohan cuts off another little slice to have some meat. Then he blasts a log to set it on fire, and roasts the meat over it with his sword. Piccolo seems impressed with his progress as he watches from afar.
"
Masters and Students,210 (DBZ 16),"The cover of this chapter shows Goku and Gohan in identical poses. Gohan is wearing damaged clothes.
 Piccolo attacks Gohan as part of their battle training Piccolo attacks Gohan as part of their battle training. Gohan flies up at Piccolo with a kick, but Piccolo just holds it off with his hand. Gohan then dives at him with a punch, but Piccolo moves out of the way and then kicks Gohan from behind. Gohan says he couldn’t see him, and Piccolo says don’t look for him, but feel him. Gohan says that’s easier said than done as he dusts himself off, and so Piccolo blasts him with some eye lasers and yells at him that they only have six months. “Other than eating and sleeping, there’s only time for fighting me! Come on.” Gohan thinks he’ll die, so Piccolo tells him if that’s the case, get stronger than him and the Saiyans. Piccolo then strikes at Gohan, and tells him to defend himself better by focusing his ki.
 Goku arrives at King Kai's planet Meanwhile, Goku continues along towards Kaiō’s place. It’s been six months, and he’s really exhausted and thinks it must go on forever. Then he finds the tail of the snake! But, there’s nothing here… But then he spots a little planet up in the air, and realizes Kaiō must be there. He jumps way up into the air to get a better look, and he spots a little house on the planet, so he must be there. But then he gets sucked right onto the surface of the planet. Goku wonders about the ground here, and thinks his body feels like lead. Goku then spots a little monkey, and thinks it must be Kaiō. He greets him and asks to receive training, and so the monkey starts dancing around with his hands in the air going “oohoohooh”. Goku thinks these weird movements must be the training, and so he starts trying to move around like the monkey. Goku tries to ask about the ground here, but the monkey just keeps making noises. Then someone asks Goku what he’s doing.
 Kaio wants Goku to tell him a joke in exchange for training There’s a plump guy, with antennae, sunglasses, and a fancy dress outfit. Goku stops, and then asks the guy who he is. “I am… Mmm… Kaiyo… Kaio… Kaiō… I’m Kaiō!” Goku asks who the monkey is then, and Kaiō says it’s his pet, Bubbles. Goku had thought it was strange, and Kaiō says, “You’re the strange one.”
Kaiō then asks if he’s come to hear his great new pun, and Goku doesn’t know what he’s talking about. Nevertheless, he tells it anyway. “Moshi moshi. Are? Daremo denwa ni… den wa!” (“Hello? Huh?… No one’s answering… the phone!”) Kaiō thinks it’s the greatest, but Goku doesn’t get it. Kaiō asks him what he wants, and Goku says to train. But Kaiō says to go home, he won’t train anyone who can’t laugh at such a great joke. Goku then bursts out laughing, and so Kaiō is pleased now. He says he’ll train Goku, so long as he passes the test — tell a pun that could make a “gag genius” like him laugh!
 Goku faces King Kai Goku freaks out, and Kaiō tells him he’d better go home if he plans on giving a weak joke. And then Goku blurts out, “Futon ga futton da!!!” (“The futon flew!!!”) Kaiō begins to chuckle, and so Goku has passed. Now Kaiō is prepared to teach him the greatest gags, but Goku says he’d come for martial arts. Kaiō tries to correct his arm placement, but Goku says it’s hard to move here. Kaiō asks if he’s from Earth, and explains that the gravity here is about ten times greater than Earth’s. So his body weighs ten times as much! He says to try jumping, and Goku can’t get much higher. Kaiō thinks that this will be fun.
"
The Hardest Time of His Death,211 (DBZ 17),"The cover of this chapter shows King Kai. Above him is Goku chasing Bubbles.
 Goku chases Bubbles Goku informs Kaio about the Saiyans that are approaching the Earth. Using his antennae, Kaio estimates their arrival at 158 days. Goku panics, but Kaio assures him that 158 days is more than enough time, and claims 158 days of training under 10x Earth's gravity is equivalent to ""a few thousand years"" of training on Earth. To beat the Saiyans, Goku will need to surpass even Kaio himself, as even he is no match for them.
 Goku's first test is to chase Kaio's pet monkey Bubbles. Goku removes his weighted clothing in order to gain a bit more speed, but still cannot manage to catch Bubbles. After dinner, Goku's told to put his weighted training clothes back on, as they will prove even more beneficial to his training.
 Back on Earth, Gohan and Piccolo are preparing to sleep. Gohan remarks that Goku used to tell him that since his reincarnation, Piccolo is not as bad as he used to be. Gohan says he understands what his father meant, which visibly agitates Piccolo, who threatens that the next day of training will be even more grueling.
 Forty days later, Goku finally manages to catch Bubbles. Kaio is so impressed, he starts to believe that Goku might even be capable of mastering the Kaio-ken, a technique that not even he himself could master.
 Kami's training is complete At The Lookout, Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu, Yamcha, Krillin and Yajirobe have completed their training, with Kami declaring they've all surpassed him. They are ordered to return to the earth to refine their training in the days leading up to the Saiyan's arrival. The chapter ends with Fortuneteller Baba meeting with Master Roshi and Bulma, unable to predict how the future will unfold.

Closer... Closer...,212 (DBZ 18),"The cover of this chapter shows the Dragon Team standing in fighting positions.
 King Kai prepares a target for Goku's Genki-Dama King Kai throws a brick at super speed, while Goku tries to sense it out and strike it with the newly learned Spirit Bomb. He succeeds, much to the surprise of King Kai, who goes on to explain that since the Genki-Dama draws its power from all surrounding life, the amount of energy it outputs on a planet as small as his would be nothing in comparison to a planet the size of the Earth. He cautions that using it might end up destroying the planet if he isn't careful, and recommends only using it as a last resort.
 The Saiyan's space pods touch down on Earth King Kai remarks that the Saiyans will be arriving the next day, but immediately panics, having forgotten to include the time it would take Goku to travel back on Snake Way in his estimation. Despite this, Goku is assured that despite taking six months previously, he can now travel the distance in two days. King Kai asks Goku to place his hand on his shoulder, which would allow him to contact his friends back on Earth. Goku telepathically reaches Master Roshi, who is currently on the toilet, and asks him to summon Shenron and wish him back to life at once.
 Bulma, Puar, Oolong and Roshi gather around as Shenron is called. Oolong wishes for the Saiyan threat to go away and Bulma asks Oolong is gonna leave Goku dead, but Shenron claims this is outside his power, as Kami created him, and he can't grant a wish beyond Kami's power. Roshi then wishes for Goku's life back as Shenron says that is a wish that he can grant and grants the wish. Back on King Kai's planet, Goku's halo disappears, and he immediately sets off on Snake Way, racing at full speed. The next morning, at 11:33am, the Saiyans arrive.
"
The Day of the Saiyans,213 (DBZ 19),"The cover of this chapter shows Vegeta and Nappa.
 Nappa and Vegeta arrive on Earth A crowd gathers around the two craters in East City, and they watch as a person exits one of the space pods. Piccolo and Gohan both sense that the Saiyans have arrived, as does Yamcha, Kuririn, Yajirobe (well, actually, he is just sitting somewhere eating some meat), and Tenshinhan and Chiaotzu. Both Saiyans are out of their ships now, and the little alien is not too impressed with Earth.
 The big alien then lifts his hand, and causes the entire city to explode, save them and their space ships. The big alien says he might have been a little too polite with his greeting. The little alien scolds him, referring to him as Nappa, and says they are not here to show off, and this planet can not be sold for much anyway. Nappa calls the little alien Vegeta, and states that they are just here to get a wish from the whatever-Balls. Vegeta says they are Dragon Balls, and first they will get information from the guy who killed Raditz. To begin they will search for the person with the highest battle power on the planet, because that will either be whoever killed Raditz or Kakarrot's son. Nappa wonders about there being a few people on this planet with battle powers over 1,000, but Vegeta says they are still no match for them. In not much time, Vegeta finds the highest reading on the planet. “Alright, Nappa. Let’s go play!” As they fly away toward Piccolo, Nappa notes how much he likes the low gravity on this planet.
 Nappa and Vegeta fly towards Gohan and Piccolo, the two strongest power levels on the planet Yamcha quickly notices that the two aliens have started moving. Kuririn also notices, saying they are heading in the direction of two large power levels. He wonders if they are going toward Tenshinhan and Chiaotzu, or towards Piccolo and Goku's kid. Piccolo yells at Gohan, “They’re coming…!! “, and Gohan says he is ready. Elsewhere Tenshinhan prepares to fly off and tells Chiaotzu to stay put, but he refuses since he went to all the trouble training for this.
 At Kame House, Bulma and everyone else are watching on the news about a large-scale earthquake in East City. Kame-Sen’nin knows that means they have come. Bulma puts on the eye device she repaired and wants to find their location, and Oolong whines about not wanting to die. Kame-Sen’nin says they had just get in the way if they go, and all they can do is wish everyone good luck. Pu’er tells Yamcha not to die, and Bulma tells Goku to hurry, who is shown still racing down Serpent Road.
 It is now 12:20 PM, and Piccolo and Gohan (who is now wearing an outfit like Piccolo's) are waiting. They feel someone coming, but it turns out to be Kuririn. Piccolo asks if he has come to get in the way, and Kuririn explains that everyone else is coming too. Gohan remembers who Kuririn is now, and says his father said he was small but strong. Kuririn does not like the small part. They talk a bit more, when Piccolo interrupts that they are here. Kuririn can not believe their incredible ki, and Vegeta asks if they were not waiting for them.
"
Let the Games Begin!,214 (DBZ 20),"The cover of this chapter shows various characters and writing all inside little square panels. The characters include Piccolo, Gohan, six Saibamen, Krillin, Vegeta, Nappa, Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu, and Yamcha. The covers of the later chapters ""The Mysterious Strangers"" and ""Trunks Surpasses His Father!"" are similar to this cover art.
 Piccolo asks them what the hell they want, and Vegeta recognizes his voice as the one who killed Raditz. Piccolo wonders about this, and Vegeta explains that their eye devices are also communicators. Nappa asks Vegeta if Piccolo is not a Namekian, and Kuririn and Gohan ask him if he is also an alien. Vegeta says he has heard Namekians have strange abilities and can use magic and stuff, so he must be the one who made these Dragon Ball things.
 Piccolo prepares to battle the Saiyans Kuririn wonders how they know about the Dragon Balls, and then Piccolo thanks them for the tale about his past, but he was not the one who made the Dragon Balls. Piccolo then prepares for them to attack. Up at God’s Palace, God says he did not know he was an alien. He always did think he was a little different from everyone else, though. He had created the Dragon Balls, but perhaps someone else on Planet Namek had created something like the Dragon Balls. He does not seem to remember. Nappa says that since he will not tell them about the Dragon Balls, he will force him to say it. Nappa reads off their battle powers (Kuririn – 981, Piccolo – 1,220, Gohan – 1,083), and cannot believe they plan to oppose them at such low levels. Vegeta then tells Nappa to remove his scouter, which is their eye device. These guys can change their battle powers at will, so the numbers are no good. Nappa thinks that weakling Raditz had relied on his scouter’s figures too much. Kuririn and Piccolo cannot believe that they called Raditz a weakling.
 The Saibaimen appear Vegeta tells Nappa to plant six Saibaimen, and Nappa says Vegeta really likes to play. Nappa pulls a little bottle out and plants six little seeds in the ground right in front of them. Then he pours some liquid from the bottle to make them sprout right away. Six freaky little plant monsters emerge, and Vegeta tells them to attack the three over there. But then Tenshinhan and Chiaotzu show up, followed shortly by Yamcha. Vegeta thinks it will be fun with six Saibaimen verses the six of them now. “It’s a game!”
 Kami reminisces about creating the Dragon Balls Piccolo gets pissed that he thinks this is a game and wants them to stop screwing around, and Kuririn tries to tell him to let it alone, since this will allow them to buy time for Goku to arrive. Tenshinhan volunteers to go first, and Vegeta sends out a Saibaiman. The Saibaiman rushes at him, but Tenshinhan just blows it back. Tenshinhan comes at it, but the Saibaiman then splits its head open and shoots out a liquid at him. Tenshinhan easily avoids it, and Kuririn and Piccolo just barely get out of the way before the stuff burns through the ground like acid. Tenshinhan then gets in a quick elbow to the face, and knocks the Saibaiman out. Nappa freaks out, but Vegeta thinks this will definitely be fun.
"
One Down...,215 (DBZ 21),"The cover of this chapter shows Goku traveling down Snake Way, and Yamcha and a Saibaman in fighting positions.
 A Saibaiman grabs Yamcha The Saibaiman can barely move as Tenshinhan walks back over to the others, and Nappa says that the Saibamen have battle powers of 1,200. Vegeta says that guy must have surpassed that, then. Nappa still cannot believe this, and then the Saibaman starts to get back up. Vegeta kills it himself, and Nappa asks why. Vegeta says it could not have won, and it was the first Saibaman anyway. He reminds the others to go all out, and the good guys wonder about these Saiyans.
 Kuririn wants to go next, but Yamcha volunteers instead, explaining that Kuririn’s already been returned to life by the Dragon Balls once, and he cannot be brought back again. Vegeta and Nappa send out the next Saibaman, and he and Yamcha go at each other and disappear from view. Gohan cannot see them at all, and Piccolo yells at Gohan to feel the movements of their ki.
 Krillin fires the Scattering Bullet Yamcha and the Saibaman exchange some punches until the Saibaman flies up onto a nearby mountain. Yamcha flies up after it, and the Saibaman then dives at Yamcha. But Yamcha flies up above the Saibaman, and then fires a Kamehameha down at it. It is a direct hit, knocking the Saibaman straight into the ground. Yamcha lands and stands over it, saying these things are not very strong and that he will take on the remaining four himself. The Saibaman suddenly jumps back up and latches onto Yamcha, then self-destructs!
 Kuririn runs over to Yamcha’s body, and confirms that he is dead. He thinks of how Yamcha had a bad feeling and died in his stead, then thinks of Pu’er and Bulma. “…Assholes!! Guys, get out of the way!!!” Kuririn then charges up, puts out both hands, and fires off a two-handed blast at Vegeta and Nappa.
"
Heroes in Terror,216 (DBZ 22),"The cover of this chapter shows Krillin, Yamcha and Puar.
 Krillin's Scattering Bullet rains down on the enemy Kuririn fires his Scattering Bullet at the Saibamen and the Saiyans. Three of the Saibamen are blown up, and almost a fourth, and Vegeta and Nappa get hit as well. When the smoke clears, everyone cheers. The Saibaiman who just barely dodged the blast comes at Gohan, but Piccolo grabs it by the arm. He punches it in the stomach, tosses it into the air, and then fires up a mouth blast, disintegrating it. Gohan thanks him, and Piccolo says he wasn’t doing it to save him, but as a warm up for the splendid fight.
 Vegeta, along with Nappa, comes out of the dust unscathed saying if a splendid fight is what they want, it’s what they’ll get. Tenshinhan can’t believe they survived, and Kuririn says he’d put his full power into that. Nappa says he wants to take on the five of them himself, and hopes they’ll make it fun for him. Kuririn says the Earth is shaking as Nappa powers up, and Chiaotzu tells Tenshinhan his Chōnōryoku is ineffective. Nappa is ready to strike, and everyone is worried.
"
Hope Runs Out,217 (DBZ 23),"The cover of this chapter is Nappa clenching his fist, smiling in a smug manner.
 Nappa powered up The chapter begins with Nappa, after he finishes charging (as seen in the previous chapter). Nappa looks around, trying to figure out he would like to kill first. In a snap decision Nappa charges at Tien Shinhan. Nappa jumps at Tien with incredible speed, Tien manages to block his attack, however. Next, Nappa uses his Arm Break technique on Tien, punching Tien's arm clean off. Nappa then pulls his fist back in an attempt to deliver a fatal blow to Tien. Tien manages to avoid the attack, jumping in the air before he is hit. Tien then begins to charge his Tri-Beam technique, but is interrupted by Nappa, who flies in the air and kicks Tien to the ground. Out of anger, Krillin then attempts to charge at Nappa, who easily blows him back with his Exploding Wave technique. After the explosion, Chiaotzu is nowhere to be found.
 Nappa's punch rips off Tien's arm The Z-Fighters are worried, hoping he did not get caught in such a strong blast. It is then seen that Chiaotzu has hopped on Nappa's back. Nappa struggles, in an attempt to get Chiaotzu get off of his back, but fails to remove him. Chiaotzu then uses Telepathy to say goodbye to his best friend, Tien. Chiaotzu then uses his Farewell, Mr. Tien, putting all of his energy into one blast, causing Chiaotzu to explode. It is then seen that Nappa was completely unaffected by Chiaotzu's technique, meaning his death was all in vain. Tien is devastated by the loss of his best friend, but Piccolo then comes up with a plan to attack Nappa. Piccolo suggests hitting him in a moment when he leaves himself wide open. Vegeta overhears this, and compliments that it is a great plan while smiling confidently. Nappa charges Tien once again, giving Piccolo the perfect moment to strike. Piccolo then smacks Nappa, followed by Krillin punching Nappa to the ground. Piccolo then shouts at Gohan to blast Nappa, but he admits he is too afraid. Piccolo and Krillin then attempt to blast Nappa, but it is too late as Nappa easily dodges. Still mourning the death of his best friend, Tien decides to put the remaining energy he had into one blast.
"
The Last Blast,218 (DBZ 24),"This chapter cover features four photos of the main characters. One photo is a picture of the Son family with Ox-King, Chi-Chi, Goku, and Gohan together. The next is Tien Shinhan, Chaozu, Yajirobe, Krillin, Mr. Popo, and Yamucha during their training on The Lookout. The bottom photo shows Launch, Bulma, Puar, Turtle, and Master Roshi at Kame House. The final photo is mostly covered up by the other photos, but Piccolo's face can be seen in a part of the photo that is showing.
 Piccolo attacks Nappa Following Chiaotzu's heroic yet ultimately futile attempt to kill Nappa via Self Destruction, Goku is still traveling down Snake Way. As he finds jumping along the path is taking too long as three hours have gone by, he decides to fly at high speed. Meanwhile, as the remaining Dragon Team confront Nappa, who decides he'll take out Tien first and then Krillin. Tien mourning Chiaotzu's sacrifice, tells Nappa he will pay. Piccolo tells Krillin and Gohan that Nappa is open to attack in the instant he attacks, so they will use that instant to launch a coordinated attack. However Vegeta overhears them and instead of warning Nappa, sarcastically notes its a good plan and hopes it works, even telling Piccolo to focus on Nappa or they'll lose their instant to attack. Piccolo notes how confident Vegeta is and hopes to see Vegeta's face when Goku arrives, causing Vegeta to ask who Goku is and if he's their secret weapon, failing to realize that Piccolo is referring to Raditz's younger brother. Nappa charges towards Tien who begins focusing energy using his remaining arm. Piccolo and Krillin use Rapid Movement and launch a combined rush attack, with Piccolo hitting Nappa hard in the face, followed up by Krillin performing a Double Axe Handle. The two turn their attention to Gohan, expecting him to fire an attack at Nappa, unfortunately the inexperienced boy freezes in fear after having witnessed the deaths of both Yamcha and Chiaotzu. Piccolo calls Gohan a coward (or ""Damn You!"") and Krillin decides they have no choice but to attack Nappa themselves, as Tien observes while gathering ki. Krillin fires a Kamehameha while Piccolo simultaneously fires a two-handed Special Beam Cannon. However Nappa dodges by ascending rapidly avoiding both energy waves, with Krillin noting their attacks were too late.
 However Tien finishes charging the rest of his energy into his remaining hand and fire his Spirit Tri-Beam at Nappa, which blows off Nappa's Battle Armor, but fails to hurt him. Tien then falls to the ground and dies. Krillin screams out for Goku to save them, due to Nappa being too much for the heroes to handle. We then see Kami and Mr. Popo on the Lookout. Kami says he no longer senses Piccolo's presence, and that very soon Piccolo will die. We then return to the battlefield, where Krillin and Piccolo are still trying to come up with a plan. Piccolo suggests he fights better in the air, so Krillin and Piccolo jump to the ground. Nappa, who does not seem to be bothered by this at all, charges Krillin and Piccolo, but is stopped by Vegeta.
 Vegeta ponders whether or not this Goku person they are waiting for is actually Kakarot (Goku's original Saiyan name). Krillin tells Vegeta it is Goku, and Vegeta taunts them. Krillin then states that Goku will be much stronger than last time. Amused by this, Vegeta decides waiting 3 hours to see if Goku will arrive. Nappa is displeased with this, and one again flies at the Dragon Team, ready to attack. Vegeta scolds Nappa for attempting to disobey him, and Nappa then stops and apologizes. Piccolo then notices form this, that if Nappa takes orders from Vegeta, Vegeta must be even stronger than he is. Nappa questions why Vegeta would like to wait for Goku, to which he responds traitors should be killed, and he wants to show them how terrible they can be.
"
"Goku, Hurry!",219 (DBZ 25),"The cover of this chapter features Goku rushing to get to Earth in time to save his friends.
 Nappa withstands Tien's Spirit Tri-Beam with relative ease To everyone's surprise, Nappa has easily survived Tien Shinhan's attack, Spirit Tri-Beam. Having used up all his energy on that final technique, Tien then falls to the ground dead. We then go to The Lookout, where we see Mr. Popo and Kami. Kami is worried and curious as to why Goku has not arrived yet. He also then gets a bad feeling. He senses that Piccolo will soon die. We then return to Earth, where the battle continues. Piccolo suggest to Krillin that Nappa is accustomed to aerial combat, and they should continue their fight on the ground, so both fly to the ground. Nappa, completely unphased by this, charges at Krillin and Piccolo. Before Nappa can attack Vegeta shouts for him to stop, which he immediately does. Vegeta then asks if this ""Son Goku"" they have been referring to was actually Kakarot. Krillin says it is, then Vegeta begins to taunt them, stating he is no match for them if he could not beat a person such as Raditz. Krillin exclaims Goku has become much stronger over the years, but Vegeta is still highly unconvinced. He is amused, however, so he decides to wait 3 hours for Goku's arrival. Nappa is not pleased with Vegeta's choice, so he continues to charge at Krillin and Piccolo. Once again, Vegeta commands him to stop. Nappa listens, and then apologizes for being so impatient. The Saiyans and the Dragon Team then group together, waiting the agonizing 3 hours. Goku is seen doing his best to get to the battle, flying along Snake Way. The 3 hour wait is over, and the fight continues.
"
Back From the Other Side,220 (DBZ 26),"The cover of this chapter shows Goku in the center riding the Flying Nimbus. Around him in four different boxes are Nappa on the top left hand corner, Gohan, Krillin, Piccolo on the top right hand corner, Vegeta on the bottom right hand corner, Korin and Kami on the bottom left hand corner.
 Kami warps Goku back to Earth Now with their extra three hours provided to them by Vegeta have run out, Piccolo, Gohan, and Krillin begin to feel hopeless now that Goku still has not arrived. Vegeta assumes Kakarot must have fled to escape the Saiyans, and Vegeta deems him a coward. Gohan angrily growls that his father his anything but a coward, but Krillin begins to agree with Vegeta, that possibly even this threat was too much for even Goku to be fearless of. As Nappa removes his damaged armor, he cracks his knuckles, and prepares to begin a new round with the Dragon Team, smirking menacingly. Krillin, with no confidence, states this wasteland will be his own grave, and the Earth will cease to exist from this day forward, as there is no hope of even denting the Saiyans now. Piccolo states however, he still has one final plan that is a huge risk, but will pay off greatly if successfully performed. As Krillin and Gohan listen carefully, Piccolo plans that Krillin shall distract Nappa, while Piccolo shall pull at Nappa's tail, remembering how much pain Raditz felt when his tail was pulled. Piccolo then states after he has handicapped Nappa by immobilizing him, Gohan and Krillin shall attack Nappa with everything they have got, and fire their best techniques. Gohan now promises he shall not flee like the last time, with Piccolo replying that if Gohan even thinks of fleeing again, the whole Earth shall fall, and that pressure is more than enough to get Gohan standing his ground. Piccolo calms Gohan by saying if he calms his mind and uses his attacks carefully, he shall probably pass even Piccolo in strength. As Nappa begins to slowly walk towards the trio, Piccolo holds a fighting position, and gets ready to put his plan into action.
 Korin throws Goku a few Senzu Beans Meanwhile, Kami and Mr. Popo on the Lookout notice that Goku has now ended his return journey on Snake Way and has now returned to King Yemma's office in the Other World, with his mentor for the past few months, King Kai amazed at Goku's progress and power. Teleporting to the office, Kami orders Goku to grab his arm and teleports back to the Lookout as quickly as possible. Wasting no time, Goku thanks Kami for the help and immediately jumps off the Lookout and begins to fly towards the Saiyans and the Z Fighter's battlefield. Korin, nearby on Korin Tower, notices that Goku is extremely tired, and decides to give him the last two Senzu Beans he has on the tower. Goku catches the beans and thanks Korin, swallowing one of the beans, gaining his full energy back, and can now fly at full speed. Goku calls out his Flying Nimbus and heads towards the battle at tremendous speed.
 Nappa reveals that he and Vegeta have overcome the weakness in their tail Meanwhile, with the Z Fighters, Krillin gives out a loud yell and leaps towards Nappa, following Piccolo's order to distract him. Vegeta however, realizes that they have a hidden plan, as they would not attempt to directly attack Nappa like that head on, but Vegeta still decides not to interfere, wanting Nappa to figure it out for himself. However, surprising Nappa, instead of attacking him, Krillin blasts two ki beams towards the ground and levitates himself into the air, as Nappa looks in confusion, thus making Krillin's attempt to draw Nappa's attention a success. Piccolo, now running as fast as he can, now manages to get behind the Saiyan, and grabs onto his tail, and proceeds to grip it tightly and torture Nappa. Piccolo now orders Gohan to rush in and attack Nappa while he is immobilized. However, in a shocking turn of events, Nappa appears unfazed by Piccolo grabbing his tail, as he elbows Piccolo directly on the head, giving the Namekian a large bruise, and knocking him out cold in one light hit. As Piccolo falls, Nappa grabs his clothing, and orders Piccolo to tell him where the Dragon Balls are. Vegeta begins to laugh, as he questions why the Z Fighters would go for such a stupid tactic against elite Saiyan warriors, who have trained their tails to be stronger against threats. As Gohan and Krillin watch in complete fear, Piccolo is now out of the battle, and Goku still has not arrived.
"
The Time Draws Near,221 (DBZ 27),"The cover of this chapter shows various different scenes of the Saiyan attack. Vegeta is shown smiling, Goku is rushing towards the battle field on the Flying Nimbus, Gohan is shown with a scared look on his face, Krillin is shown holding the Destructo Disc and Nappa is shown with a cut on his cheek.
 Krillin charges a Destructo Disk Nappa now has his eye on Gohan, who is standing right in front of him, and tells him that since he’s part Saiyan, he needs to make it fun. He kicks Gohan into the air, and then swats him into a nearby mountain. Gohan struggles back to his feet, coughing up blood, as Nappa comes at him. But Kuririn then jumps in and kicks Nappa in the face, and punches him off into the distance. Kuririn flies after Nappa, and Nappa catches himself and flies back toward Kuririn. Nappa punches at Kuririn, but Kuririn does a few back flips to get out of the way. Nappa rushes at him again, and so Kuririn puts his right hand into the air, palm up, and forms a Destructo Disc above his hand. He announces the Kienzan, and then launches it toward Nappa. Nappa stands to take it head on, but Vegeta yells to get out of the way. Nappa just barely moves aside, and the Kienzan slices through a mountain like a saw blade. It did graze Nappa’s cheek, leaving a nasty little cut.
 Nappa’s pissed now, and throws a blast at Kuririn. Kuririn jumps up out of the way, but is hit by the shockwave. Nappa prepares to finish him off, when Piccolo suddenly blasts him in the back, leaving a nice burn mark. Vegeta laughs at Nappa and thinks they’re too much for him, and then Piccolo suddenly feels an unbelievable ki. Nappa thinks they’re talking about him, but Piccolo says it’s Son Goku!
"
The Death of a God!!,222 (DBZ 28),"The cover of this chapter shows Goku riding the Flying Nimbus.
 Piccolo shields Gohan from Nappa's Bomber DX Piccolo yells that it’s definitely Son Goku, and Gohan gets excited about his father coming. Nappa asks where Kakarrot is, and Vegeta picks up his scouter again and decides to find out. Goku continues zooming along on Kinto-Un, and says he feels two huge ki, two even huger ki, and one small ki. That figure must be wrong, so he wonders who is dead, and asks Kinto-Un to speed up. Vegeta reads his scouter, and his eyes then widen. He tells Nappa that Kakarrot will be here in four minutes, and that he has a battle power of 5,000! Vegeta thinks that if these guys here were able to change their figure so much, then Kakarrot must be able to make his change that much too.
 Vegeta yells at Nappa to kill them all, and Nappa asks what about the Dragon Balls. Vegeta says he figures that on the Namekian’s home world, Planet Namek, they probably have even stronger Dragon Balls. Since Kakarrot’s returned to life, the legend must be true. Gohan begins yelling at Piccolo, telling him to run away. “I’ll hold him off until Father comes!! Because if Piccolo-san dies, God also dies, and the Dragon Balls will…!!!”
 Piccolo thinks Gohan can’t hold him off by himself, and Kuririn can’t even move. “Hold me off, you say…? You’re making me laugh, brat!!!!” Nappa charges toward Gohan, but then Gohan gets pissed and kicks Nappa in the face, sending him flying into a nearby mountain. Nappa gets right back up out from the rubble, all busted up, and is seriously pissed. He then charges up, and launches an explosive blast at Gohan. Gohan can’t get away in time, but Piccolo suddenly runs in and stands in front of him, taking the blast himself.
"
Piccolo's Last Stand,223 (DBZ 29),"The cover of this chapter shows Piccolo standing badly injured and Gohan standing behind him.
 Piccolo's flesh smokes after taking the brunt of Nappa's Bomber DX Nappa laughs about his attack, but is surprised to see it hit Piccolo instead. The busted up Piccolo weakly tells Gohan to run away, and then falls to the ground. Gohan asks why he saved him, and he just says to run away again. Gohan cries at him not to die, and Nappa laughs at him taking his turn to die early. Goku continues zooming along on Kinto-Un, but he feels one ki rapidly getting smaller and he wonders who’s dying. Up at God’s Palace, God is fading away as well. He says Goku didn’t make it in time, but he’s at least glad that Piccolo died like that.
 Piccolo laughs about how bad it is that Piccolo Daimaō died protecting a brat. Then he says that Gohan is the only one who’s ever really talked to him. “All these months with you… weren’t so bad… Don’t… die… Go…han…” Goku then feels his ki disappear, as God also bids farewell to Mister Popo. Back on the battlefield, Gohan starts crying, but also gets really angry in the process. He puts his hands over his head and screams, “Masenkō!!!!” Vegeta gets a reading of 2,800 on his scouter, and can’t believe how much they really can change their battle power.
 Gohan fires his Masenko right at Nappa, but Nappa manages to swat it away. Nappa says that he hurt his arm on that, and Vegeta says his battle power has gone back down now. Kuririn thinks they are just too strong. Gohan apologizes to Piccolo for not being able to get revenge, and now he does not even have the strength to run away. Kuririn still can’t move at all, as Nappa walks over to finish off Gohan.
 Gohan saved by the Kinto'un Nappa tries to crush Gohan with his foot, but when he looks down he notices that Gohan is gone and sees him floating nearby on Kinto-Un. Gohan himself is surprised to see Kinto-Un. Vegeta then looks up into the sky, and Gohan and Kuririn both get excited. “So you’ve finally appeared!!”, says Vegeta as Goku lands on the ground.

The Quiet Wrath of Son Goku,224 (DBZ 30),"The cover of this chapter shows Goku with a look of anger on his face. In front of him, characters killed during the Saiyan attack can be seen in little circles. These characters include Kami, Piccolo, Yamcha, Tien Shinhan, and Chiaotzu.
 Goku powers up Gohan and Kuririn are really happy to see Goku, and Vegeta says he must have come to tell a stupid joke about defeating them. Goku walks over past Nappa toward Piccolo’s body, checking to see if he’s absolutely dead. “Piccolo-san died protecting me…” Goku then sees Tenshinhan and Yamcha’s bodies, and Nappa laughs that there was one more little dude, and Goku realizes Chiaotzu is also dead. And of course now God is too. Vegeta notices that his battle power is now rising, as he walks over near Nappa. Nappa thinks he wants to die, and so he takes a swing at him.
 But Goku simply walks right past him over toward Gohan and Kuririn, and splits the last senzu between the two of them. Goku tells Kuririn that he’s gotten really strong, but Kuririn says it still was not enough since everyone’s dead. Goku also compliments Gohan, and Gohan says Piccolo taught him well, but he still couldn’t do anything. Speaking of whom, Kuririn remembers that they can’t use the Dragon Balls anymore, and tells Goku that they’ll need to beat these guys on their three friends’ behalf. Goku says it will be just him fighting this time, but both Kuririn and Gohan object.
 Goku kicks the back of Nappa's head Goku ignores them and starts to get mad, and so Kuririn grabs Gohan saying they should leave like he said. He walks over toward Nappa, who laughs and thinks he must want to die real bad. “I won’t forgive you, you bastards…!!” Goku then starts to really power up, with the Earth shaking and rocks flying into the air as he does. Vegeta’s scouter gets to 7,000… 8,000… and then Goku stops. Nappa asks what Kakarrot’s battle power is now, and Vegeta tells him it’s 8,000, as he takes off his scouter and angrily smashes it. Goku tells him not to worry, because he’s still not using the Kaiō-Ken on him. Vegeta wonders about this “Kaiō-Ken”, and Nappa gets pissed. In a brief flash, Goku gets behind Nappa and kicks him face first into the ground.
"
Vengeance,225 (DBZ 31),"The cover of this chapter shows Goku riding a Capsule 34 machine. He has the Power Pole slung across his back.
 Goku effortlessly eludes Nappa's attacks Nappa is pissed, and Goku tells him, “You ain’t in my league.” Kuririn and Gohan watch from a safe distance and wonder about this turn of events, and Vegeta notes that his battle power is completely different from when he fought Raditz. Nappa intends to prove him wrong, and so he powers up and rushes at Goku. But Goku easily dodges all of his punches and kicks, and then finally ends up a distance away. Neither Kuririn nor Gohan can follow Goku’s movements, and Vegeta wonders how Kakarrot’s gotten so much stronger.
 Goku rushes toward Nappa, and then stands on his head. Nappa tries to put his hands above his head and crush him, but Goku ends up in front of him again, and punches him in the stomach. “That one was for Chiaotzu!” Nappa tries to kick him, but Goku ducks it and punches him again, sending him flying. “For Yamcha!!!” Nappa catches himself mid-air just before he hits a mountain, and throws an explosive blast down toward Goku. Goku nullifies it with a mere kiai, and then heads up into the air and knocks Nappa toward the ground with a Double Axe Handle. “This is for Tenshinhan!!”
 Goku dives down after him, and flies at him with a kick. “For Piccolo!!” Nappa busts into a mountain, but flies out soon afterwards, super pissed this time. Nappa screams that he’s an elite warrior and Goku is a low-class warrior, as Kuririn and Gohan get excited at Goku’s strength. Vegeta then yells at Nappa to calm down and think clearly, and so Nappa does and thanks him for the tip. Vegeta thinks of what an idiot Nappa is, and that his turn has finally come.
"
The Mystery of the Kaio-ken,226 (DBZ 32),"The cover of this chapter shows Bulma wearing a Capsule Corporation hat. She is holding onto a bike.
 Goku paralyzes Nappa Nappa is pissed, and Goku tells him “You ain’t in my league.” Kuririn and Gohan watch from a safe Nappa says Kakarrot made his head bleed, and asks him if he’s ready. Goku says this is the fight he wanted, and Nappa says he’s bluffing. Though Vegeta thinks otherwise. Nappa starts powering up and lifts his hand, causing the ground below Goku to explode. Goku manages to fly out of it, but Nappa spots him and flies after. Nappa punches at Goku, but Goku blocks it and kicks him in the face. The two exchange a few blows, and then they break.
 Goku tells Nappa he’s gotten a lot better, and this just makes Nappa laugh and threaten to end this. Nappa fires a huge blast from his mouth at Goku, and just before it hits, Goku blasts it away with a Kamehameha. There’s a big explosion when the two blasts connect, and Vegeta is shocked that he blocked it in such a brief instant. Nappa can’t believe this, as that was his best technique. Goku says he’s a pretty tough bastard.
 Vegeta yells at Nappa that he’s done enough, now he’ll take of it himself. Kuririn and Gohan are surprised that Vegeta will finally show himself, and wonder what kind of power he has if even the huge guy is scared of him. Nappa is pissed at this, but tells Goku that he’ll soon be sorry it came to this, for Vegeta is a genius fighter who was named after the Planet Vegeta. Nappa begins his descent, but then looks down toward Kuririn and Gohan and dives toward them. Goku realizes what he’s doing and that he won’t be able to make it in time.
 Goku yells “Kaiō-Ken!!!!!”, suddenly speeds up, hits Nappa in the back, and then stands on the ground, catching Nappa. Goku holds him over his head with one hand, and then throws him to the ground right in front of Vegeta. Goku says he can’t fight anymore, and tells Vegeta to take him and leave Earth. Vegeta thinks, “What was that just now… In just an instant his speed and power suddenly grew!!”
"
The Last of Nappa,227 (DBZ 33),"The cover of this chapter shows Vegeta smiling and Goku in a fighting stance.
 Vegeta hurls Nappa into the air Vegeta still can’t believe this, and Kuririn asks Goku if that was a technique he learned from Kaiō. Goku explains that it’s the Kaiō-Ken, and it allows you to control all the ki throughout your body and amplify it in an instant. If you do it right, your strength, speed, destructive power, and defensive power will all greatly increase. Kuririn and Gohan are really impressed, and Goku explains that it’s not all good.
 A flashback is shown of Kaiō explaining that if a mistake is made controlling the Kaiō-Ken, it will break down your body. “At the most, 2x is as much as you can go. Anymore than that will be too big a burden on your body.” Meanwhile, Nappa begs Vegeta for help. Vegeta leans in and takes his hand, and then smirks and tosses him into the air. “There’s no use for a paralyzed Saiyan who can’t move!!!” Vegeta starts to power up, and sends a blast up at Nappa that causes a huge explosion.
 Vegeta fires his Galaxy Breaker, killing Nappa Goku has made it safely into the air, holding onto both Kuririn and Gohan. Kuririn can’t believe he would kill his own ally. Goku tells the two of them to hurry to Kame House immediately. Gohan is reluctant, but Kuririn explains that they’ll just be in the way if they stay here. Kuririn asks Goku to change locations, so they don’t disturb anyone’s dead bodies here for when they return to life. Goku says with Piccolo and God dead, the Dragon Balls can never be used again. Gohan wonders if Kuririn doesn’t mean… Kuririn says he’ll tell Goku everything afterwards, if he’s able to beat that guy.
 Goku says that in any case, he needs to win, and he’ll change locations like they asked. Kuririn says it’s bad whenever they have to leave fate all up to Goku. Then Kuririn puts out his hand and says, “Don’t you dare die, old friend…!” They shake, and then Goku pats Gohan on the head and says they should go fishing. Then Goku finally lands, and tells Vegeta they should change locations. Vegeta doesn’t care, it’ll the same result no matter where they go. The two of them fly off, and come to a rocky desert location with lots of rock formations. Vegeta laughs and says he’s chosen this place as his grave.

 Goku and Vegeta stare each other down in this iconic scene Vegeta tells Goku he should be glad that a low class warrior like him is able to play with a super elite warrior. ""Immediately after a Saiyan is born, he is checked for his fighting ability. And if he is a low numbered piece of trash like you, he is sent to a planet where the inhabitants pose no threat."" Goku says he is here on Earth because of that, and thanks him. He also says he will have to try desperately to surpass the elite status. Vegeta thinks that was a funny joke, and says he will show him a level that can not be surpassed.
 The two of them take a fighting stance, and then Goku rushes at Vegeta. They block each other's punches, and then Vegeta does a few back flips to avoid a kick from Goku. They fly back toward each other, and Vegeta elbows Goku in the face. Goku catches himself before he crashes, and then heads back up into the air. Vegeta comes from behind and swings at him, but Goku ducks it. Vegeta dodges a kick from Goku, and Goku dodges a kick from him.

Goku hits him some more, and then kicks him off into the distance. Goku flies after him, but Vegeta speeds up and comes back toward Goku with a kick. They both land, and Goku can not believe this.

 Goku strikes Vegeta while in his three-times Kaio-Ken state Goku thinks about the risks of Kaiō-Ken x3 on his body, and Vegeta yells at him to come on. As Vegeta goes on about how he is number one among the Saiyans, Goku thinks that he’d just lose anyway if he doesn’t use it. Yajirobe thinks he should run away, but then Vegeta perks up, noticing Kakarrot is now powering up. “Body, hold together!! Kaiō-Ken times three!!!!!” Far away on his little planet, Kaiō begins worrying about him using more than x2, and can’t believe the situation. All of the “civilians” are at Kame House now, and Bulma is checking on the battle with Raditz’s scouter. It’s going off like crazy; 17,000… 19,000… 21,000… And then it blows up!

Then Goku zooms down below the falling Vegeta, and flies straight up to attack him, but Vegeta catches himself and prepares for the attack.
 Goku makes a sharp turn right in front of Vegeta, and so Vegeta frantically tries to turn and throw a blast at him. But Goku zooms out of the way and then kicks Vegeta straight through a rock formation. Vegeta busts out of the rubble, screaming like a madman, and then Goku flies at him. Vegeta frantically tries to punch him, but Goku easily avoids it by jumping over him. Then Goku flies back at Vegeta from behind, and knees him in the back, sending Vegeta into the air.

Battle in the Red Zone!!,231 (DBZ 37),"The cover of this chapter shows an injured Goku.
 Vegeta fires his Galick Gun Vegeta is shown to be angered at the fact that Goku's power has surpassed his own. Having enough of it, Vegeta decides to destroy Earth with his Galick Gun attack. However, Goku manages to counter the blast with a Kaio-ken Kamehameha and overpowers Vegeta, seemingly defeating the Saiyan prince.
"
The Moon,232 (DBZ 38),"The cover of this chapter shows Vegeta standing with damaged Battle Armor. Goku and a Great Ape can be seen behind him.
 Vegeta explains the concept of Blutz Waves Goku is really worn down, and Yajirobe is glad it’s over, and runs over to Goku. “Son!!! You did it, didn’t ya, you bastard!!!” Goku wonders what he’s doing here, and Yajirobe compliments him on beating that other bastard. He pats Goku on the back, which Goku finds extremely painful. Yajirobe asks what’s wrong, and Goku explains that he used a technique that was too much for his body. Goku then tells Yajirobe he should run away, and Yajirobe wonders if he doesn’t mean… Goku says Vegeta’s still alive, and also says, “I think I’ve already reached my limits.” Yajirobe then takes this opportunity to run away.
 The Kamehameha is still shooting Vegeta up through the sky, but Vegeta finally breaks away from it. goes insane at the fact that Kakarrot overpowered him. He’s supposed to be the No. 1 Saiyan. Vegeta then calms down and decides that despite how ugly he’ll become, he’ll transform into an Ōzaru, which brings out the true strength in a Saiyan. Vegeta then looks around for the moon, but can’t find it, and thinks it must not be time for it yet.
 Vegeta transforms into a Great Ape Kaiō laughs about how he can’t find the moon, as that guy named Piccolo destroyed it. Kaiō also tells Goku telepathically that even though he has no strength left, he can still use the Genki-Dama. And Goku wonders why Vegeta hasn’t come back yet. Meanwhile, Vegeta thinks they must have already destroyed the moon, but he doesn’t seem to be concerned at all… Goku then feels Vegeta returning to the battlefield. Vegeta tells him that he notices the moon is gone, and Goku doesn’t see what that has to do with anything. So, Vegeta explains that they transform upon seeing the full moon. “As you know, the light of the moon is just a reflection of solar light. But, when it’s reflected off the moon, that sunlight produces Brutz Waves. And if these Brutz Waves come from a full moon, they’re over 17 million Zeno. If our eyes take in Brutz Waves over 17 million Zeno, our tail will respond to it and you’ll begin to transform. There are many moons throughout the universe, however no matter what their size, none can produce a Brutz Wave over 17 million Zeno without being full. However… A Saiyan in need can create a small artificial moon full of Brutz Waves over 17 million Zeno . I’ll blend this Power Ball in with the oxygen of this planet to make it grow in no time!!!”
 “Sorry for the delay, Kakarrot!!! At last, your time to die has arrived…!!! After all, a low class warrior shouldn’t challenge a super elite warrior to a fight!!! Fuhahahaha…” Goku does not quite understand what is going on as Vegeta tosses the Power Ball way up into the air and yells at it to blend in. It begins to expand, and even Kaiō freaks out. Vegeta stares up at it, and then begins to transform.
"
The Energy Sphere,233 (DBZ 39),"The cover of this chapter shows Goku with his hands held high in the air, with Great Ape Vegeta towering over him. Vegeta is wearing damaged Battle Armor.
 Kuririn and Gohan are just a little bit away from Kame House now, but then they spot the Power Ball glowing from far away, and wonder what it is. They also feel a tremendous ki, which doesn’t belong to Goku, and they think this is no good. Gohan says he’s going back, but Kuririn explains that he can’t. Gohan insists that he must go, and flies off, and then Kuririn hurries and tries to go with him. Meanwhile, Goku is freaking out at the sight of Ōzaru Vegeta.
 “Guhahaha, how’s this, Kakarrot!!! Now your end has come!!!!” Goku then says, “Ōzaru… The Ōzaru monster…” Vegeta then explains to him that an Ōzaru Saiyan has a battle power ten times that of one in their human form. Goku has a flashback to Grandpa telling him that he shouldn’t go out on the night of the full moon because of the Ōzaru monster, and he’ll only be safe if he’s sleeping. And he also thinks about God having prevented his tail from ever growing back. Goku finally realizes that the monster, who killed his Grandpa and busted up the Tenka’ichi Budōkai arena, was him!
 Great Ape Vegeta towers over Goku Yajirobe can’t believe this monster, and then recognizes that it has the same clothes as the Saiyan. And Goku thinks to himself, “The Earth and I will make you take this Genki-Dama!!!” Vegeta punches down at the ground where Goku is, but Goku just barely jumps up out of the way. Then Vegeta kicks Goku off across the ground. Goku lays there hurt as Vegeta comes back at him, but then screams, “Ka-Kaiō-Ken!!!!”, and flies up into the air. However, Vegeta simply whacks him away with his tail.
 Goku manages to catch himself mid-air, and Vegeta comes right back after him. Goku wonders what he can possibly do; there’s no time to concentrate for a Genki-Dama, and Kaiō-Ken x5 wouldn’t even do any good. Goku wishes he had more time, there’s only ten seconds left, and then he gets an idea to borrow one of Tenshinhan’s techniques. “Taiyō-Ken!!!!!” It hits Ōzaru Vegeta right in the eyes, and Goku zooms away over the top of the rock formations. “E-Earth, the seas, and all the living things… Please lend me just a bit of your genki…!!! I beg of you!!!” Goku puts his hands into the air, and Vegeta is pissed he can’t see anything.
"
All That Power...,234 (DBZ 40),"On the cover of this chapter, Goku, Krillin and Gohan can be seen with Vegeta as a Great Ape behind them.
 Great Ape Vegeta's Super Galick Blaster Goku continues gathering energy for the Genki-Dama, and then notices Vegeta’s eyesight is beginning to return, but thinks he won’t find him so easily this far away. Vegeta’s really pissed, and can’t see him, but then he notices Goku off in the distance. Goku realizes he’s been found, but thinks he’s still got some time before he arrives. And finally Goku’s done it; he’s gathered all of the Earth’s genki. “Take this!!!!!” Vegeta suddenly fires a huge mouth blast at Goku, causing a huge explosion and blowing up the rock formation Goku was standing on. Yajirobe is blown away, and Gohan and Kuririn continue flying back toward the battlefield. Goku hadn’t counted on an attack like that, and says all his work on the Genki-Dama has gone to nothing. Goku’s left shoulder is all busted up now, and he thinks it’s all over. Vegeta stomps over toward him, and then prepares to step on him, but Goku just barely jumps up out of the way. Vegeta quickly swats Goku into a nearby rock formation, and he falls to the ground. Goku can barely move now, and Vegeta starts stepping on him.
 Gohan and Kuririn continue on toward the battlefield, and notice that Goku’s ki is getting smaller by the minute. Vegeta lifts his foot up, and then starts lecturing Kakarrot. Goku lies there, thinking this is the end, and then Vegeta prepares to smush Goku down with one of his fingers. But Goku suddenly fires a one-handed blast into Vegeta’s right eye. Goku says he has no strength left at all, and tells Vegeta to do as he likes. Vegeta’s eye is messed up now, and bleeding. He’s seriously pissed about Kakarrot damaging his face, and then picks him up in his hands and begins to squeeze him.

The Last Heartbeat,235 (DBZ 41),"The cover of this chapter shows Yajirobe standing, arms crossed, with a blade of grass in his mouth.
 Vegeta crushes Goku Vegeta continues squeezing Goku, as Yajirobe, who’s amazingly still around, watches. He thinks there’s nothing he can do. Vegeta then starts squeezing harder, and Yajirobe can’t bear the sound of Goku screaming in agony. Kuririn and Gohan are approaching the battlefield, and Kuririn wonders what the weird ball of light is. Then they fly in and spot Goku and Vegeta down below them, and Kuririn suddenly yells at Gohan to get down. Kuririn realizes Vegeta has become an Ōzaru, as Yajirobe watches the two of them take the ground.
 Vegeta continues crushing Goku, and Kuririn and Gohan decide to run in toward Vegeta from behind. Yajirobe then suddenly runs out and yells at them that the monster over there is the Saiyan. Kuririn says they know that, and they also know that cutting off his tail will revert him back to normal. Kuririn tells the two of them to distract Vegeta from the front, while he cuts off the tail from behind. They all rush forward, except Yajirobe, who thinks they don’t realize just how strong Vegeta is compared to them.
 Yajirobe slices off Vegeta's tail, causing him to revert to his regular form Kuririn thinks Goku's ki is almost completely gone, and realizes his death is near. Vegeta then notices something nearby, and Gohan shouts, “Over here!!! Let Father go!!!” Vegeta tells him he has good timing, because Kakarrot is on the verge of death, so he gets to see him finish off his father. Kuririn raises his hand into the air and forms a Kienzan, as Vegeta tells Gohan to watch closely. Then Kuririn launches it, but just before it’s about to hit its target, Vegeta jumps over it! It slices through a rock formation instead, including the one Gohan is standing on.
 Kuririn and Gohan can not believe this, and Vegeta tells them after Kakarrot, he will take care of them. Kuririn is pissed at the situation, and asks Goku for forgiveness in being unable to do anything. Vegeta then prepares to crush Goku between his hands once and for all, but then… Yajirobe slices off Vegeta’s tail with his sword, and then promptly runs away! Vegeta hadn’t counted on a third brat, and drops Goku to the ground as he begins to return to normal.

Least Resistance,236 (DBZ 42),"The cover of this chapter shows Krillin, Gohan, and Yajirobe standing in Gizard Wasteland, while an injured Goku lying in the background.
 Vegeta attacks a crippled Goku Kuririn is elated Yajirobe did such a thing, while Yajirobe is scared and hiding behind a rock. Gohan is still freaked out and does not know what has happened, and Vegeta gets pissed and screams that he’ll kill all of them. He charges toward Gohan, but then stops right in front of him, punching him in the gut. Gohan falls forward clutching himself and Vegeta prepares to attack him again, but Kuririn flies in. However Vegeta knows he’s coming and turns around, kicking Kuririn into a nearby rock formation. Vegeta mocks him saying he couldn’t wait his turn, as Yajirobe looks on, scared.
 Vegeta turns his attention back to Gohan, and tells him to get up and make this more fun. Vegeta then picks him up by the shirt and thinks he is trash. He head butts Gohan hard, noting that apparently even trash has red blood. Vegeta decides to be kind and have him die right next to his father, and throws him up next to Goku. Goku tells Gohan that he can not move, so he asks Gohan to please fight for him. Gohan says it is no use, he is too strong. Vegeta decides it is time to finally kill Kakarrot, followed by Kakarrot’s brat, the bald bastard, and finally that bastard who cut off his tail. Yajirobe freaks out when he hears he remembered that.
 Gohan shouts in frustration Goku tells Gohan that even if he can not win, he should at least hold him off. He should have more awesome power than Vegeta, and then Kuririn can finish him off. Kuririn slowly starts to get back to his feet, and Gohan says he can not move. Goku yells at him not to be stupid and remember what Piccolo taught him. Vegeta suddenly lands knee first on Goku's stomach, and Goku coughs up some more blood. Vegeta starts kicking Goku, and Gohan starts to get pissed. “Stop it!!!!!” Vegeta turns around, and Gohan declares he will defeat him.
 “You’ll defeat me?”, Vegeta asks smugly. Gohan fires a blast at him, but Vegeta jumps over it. Then Gohan jump kicks Vegeta, sending him flying. Gohan flies after him, but Vegeta turns around and kicks Gohan in the face. Goku asks Kuririn if he can hear him, as Gohan and Vegeta exchange blows. Gohan is sent flying, and Vegeta says, “Don’t mess with Vegeta!!” Vegeta prepares to attack him again, as Kuririn walks over toward Goku, thinking Vegeta’s just too much for them. Goku tells Kuririn he wants to pass the Spirit Bomb he gathered from the Earth over to him.

One More... the Sphere!,237 (DBZ 43),"The cover of this chapter shows Yajirobe, Krillin and Gohan with Vegeta seen in a panel behind them. The cover art for this chapter is also featured in the artbooks Akira Toriyama - The World Special and Daizenshuu 1.
 Krillin receives the Fusion Spirit Bomb from Goku Gohan and Vegeta continue fighting, and Kuririn asks Goku what he is talking about. Goku explains that it is the Genki-Dama, which little by little gathers ki from the Earth. About half of it is gone, but what remains should still be enough to defeat that guy. Goku then tells Kuririn to grasp his hand. Kuririn has no idea what is going on, and Goku yells at him to hurry up before Gohan dies. Vegeta then kicks Gohan and sends him flying. Kuririn takes Goku's hand, and Goku grunts in pain. Kuririn says his bones are broken, but Goku tells him to hold on nevertheless. Goku’s hand starts to glow, and then suddenly Kuririn's does instead. Kuririn freaks out and thinks this is amazing, and Goku tells him to concentrate and he can make it into a ball. Vegeta knocks Gohan toward the ground, but Gohan catches himself from landing hard. Gohan wishes Kuririn luck, since he can not really control his ki. A ball then pops out of Kuririn's hand; it is the Genki-Dama. Vegeta gets pissed and flies at Gohan with an elbow to the face.
 Vegeta's Super Energy Wave Volley Goku asks Kuririn to please hit Vegeta with that, as he can not make another Genki-Dama, and Kuririn promises to try. Gohan gets up, and can’t believe how strong he is, as Kuririn flies up to the top of a nearby rock formation with the Genki-Dama. Vegeta charges at Gohan, and launches a blast his way. Gohan just barely dodges it, and fires off a Masenkō back at him. Vegeta prepares to take it head on, but actually dodges it at the last second. Kuririn is pissed that he can’t launch the Genki-Dama, but then someone telepathically tells him not to aim with his eyes, but to feel the evil ki and fire at that. “I’m the person who taught Son Goku the Genki-Dama, Kaiō.” Kaiō tells Kuririn that everything rests on that Genki-Dama, and it is full of the Earth's wishes. Vegeta approaches Gohan again, as Kuririn prepares to launch the Genki-Dama. Vegeta puts both hands at his side, and then repeatedly fires off blasts from each of them over at Gohan. Gohan just barely avoids all of this, being blown back a bit by the explosions of each. Kuririn continues to try to concentrate, as Yajirobe spots Kuririn up atop the rocks holding the Genki-Dama. The blasts stop, and Gohan is down. Vegeta then rushes at him, telling Kakarrot to watch as he finishes off his son. Kuririn suddenly feels it, but then Yajirobe yells up at him “What the hell are you doing, dumbass!!! Hurry up and do it!!!!” Vegeta hears him and stops, just as Kuririn launches it. And Vegeta attempts to dodge it at the last second.

 Gohan deflects the Fusion Spirit Bomb back at Vegeta As Vegeta manages to dodge the Spirit Bomb, all hope seems to be lost. However, Goku telepathically contacts his son, Gohan, and tells him to bounce the Spirit Bomb as he does have a pure heart. Gohan bounces it back and directly hits Vegeta. As the Dragon Team celebrate their seeming victory, Vegeta shows that he is alive and even manages to stand up. He slaps Krillin aside and states that, once he kills all of them, he will destroy Earth.

 Gohan begins to transform into a Great Ape Vegeta is shown to be angry at the fact that while he has been hurt physically, his pride has been hurt worse for the fact that he struggled with low-level warriors. He releases some of his remaining power, but all the warriors are shown to be alive. As Vegeta heads toward Gohan to finish him off, he remarks that Gohan's tail has grown back. He decides to immediately pull the tail off, however, Yajirobe intervenes and manages to cut Vegeta in the back, slightly injuring him. Vegeta gets back up and rapidly kicks Yajirobe into rocks. Just as he heads back to Gohan to prevent him from transforming into a Great Ape, Gohan looks at the sky and starts to transform.

Monkey in the Moon,240 (DBZ 46),"The cover shows Gohan smiling in front of multiple panels showing scenes of the battle.
 Gohan begins to transform Gohan continues transforming, and Vegeta tries to kill him before it is completed, but then it is too late. Kuririn thinks Goku is taking a big risk with this. Vegeta remembers to try and attack the tail, but Ōzaru Gohan punches him on the head before he can do anything. Gohan stands up and starts thrashing around, and Vegeta looks scared. Kuririn remembers that Goku had no reason when he was an Ōzaru, but what about Gohan. Gohan busts up some nearby rock formations, and rubble lands on Kuririn. Kuririn thinks some more about the situation, and then yells at Gohan to attack the Saiyan.
 Great Ape Gohan towers over Vegeta Gohan suddenly stops, and then takes the giant rock he is holding over his head and throws it down toward Vegeta. Vegeta just barely jumps out of the way, and Kuririn realizes Gohan still has some of his mind left, being half Earthling. Vegeta is pissed and says he needs to cut off the tail, since the moon he made will not disappear for another hour. Gohan jumps up into the air, as Vegeta forms a Kienzan. Then as Gohan comes down toward Vegeta, he jumps up and launches it, and the Kienzan slices off Gohan's tail.
 Scientists at the Saiyan landing site are surprised as Vegeta's ship flies away Gohan falls forward as he reverts to his normal form, and Vegeta can not get out of his way in time. The remaining bulk of Gohan lands on Vegeta as they hit the ground. Gohan is soon back to normal, naked and is passed out next to Vegeta. Vegeta struggles to reach into his chest armor to pull out a little remote control, and then he fiddles with it and stops moving altogether. Kuririn thinks he must be invulnerable to still be able to move. Meanwhile, over in the remains of East City, some scientists are excavating through the ruins, and they come across one of the two space pods. Suddenly it shoots up into the air and flies away. Vegeta can not believe this has happened.

Goku's Request,241 (DBZ 47),"The cover shows Goku facing Vegeta.
 Bulma, Master Roshi, Korin, and Chi-Chi are flying in an aircraft to where the battle is taking place. Chi-Chi is extremely worried about Gohan, and becomes angry at Korin who can only say that Gohan is ""probably"" alive. Kame-Sen'nin confirms that four or five people are still alive but he is barely able to feel their ki.
 Goku tells Kuririn to let Vegeta go Meanwhile, Vegeta's space pod arrives. As he tries to crawl into it, Krillin picks up Yajirobe's katana and approaches him, intending to kill Vegeta once and for all. On his planet, the King Kai seems to be happy about this, although he notes that he really should not be playing favorites, but that the Saiyans have made much trouble across the galaxy. As Kuririn starts to thrust the sword down on Vegeta, he is telepathically told to stop. Realizing that it was Goku, Kuririn asks Goku why he had told him to stop. Goku, too hurt to use his voice, tells Kuririn through his mind that he has only one request: let Vegeta go. Kuririn calls Goku crazy, saying that a tyrant like Vegeta will never change his ways and that he will come back to Earth again if let go. Goku agrees that he will return, but says that he is determined to surpass Vegeta and beat him when he does. Reluctantly, Kuririn drops the sword. Vegeta leaves one last remark about how there will not be any miracles next time and flies off in his space pod. Kuririn picks up the unconscious Gohan, and Yajirobe, who did not hear Goku's telepathic plea, calls Krillin an idiot for not finishing Vegeta off. Goku apologizes to Kuririn, but he responds that what they need to think about now our their dead allies and if there is a way to bring them back. Just then, Bulma, Kame-Sen'nin, Korin, and Chi-Chi arrive on the scene.
"
The Bittersweet End,242 (DBZ 48),"The cover of this chapter shows a night sky with Bulma's aircraft flying above the rocky ground.
 Bulma, Chi-Chi, Master Roshi, and Korin arrive at Gizard Wasteland. Chi-Chi rushes out of the ship, shouting for Gohan frantically. Running as fast as she can and jumping over her seriously injured husband Goku, Chi-Chi takes Gohan from Krillin and hugs his unconscious, naked body telling him she will never leave him again. Kuririn mentions Goku's pitiful state to Chi-Chi but she is obviously not listening. Kuririn walks over to Goku who is being surrounded by Kame-Sen'nin, Korin, and Bulma. Kuririn tells them that they got everybody but us ""four"". Bulma reacts cheerfully and says that we will bring them back the next year with the Dragon Balls. Goku breaks the news to Bulma that Piccolo died and the Dragon Balls are gone. None of their friends can be brought back to life. Bulma does not believe this and says that Piccolo has to be alive but Yajirobe walks up confirming he was the fourth. Bulma breaks down and they all board the ship.
 In the ship, Kuririn gives the directions to where the bodies of their fallen friends are. On the way, he mentions how it is possible that they can still be brought back to life. The ship arrives and they take the bodies in. Although Yamcha, Tien Shinhan, and Piccolo's bodies are present, Chiaotzu's body is absent due to self-destructing earlier in a failed attempt to kill Nappa. When the ship flies off again, Gohan regains consciousness. He realizes he is in his mother's arms and the others inform him of the Vegeta's departure. Gohan is happy to see that his father is alive, albeit crippled.
 Kuririn informs everyone that the Saiyans said something along the lines of: If we can not find the Dragon Balls here we can always go to Namek. Planet Namek is where Piccolo and Kami are from, according to the Saiyans. Bulma appears less than enthusiastic about this news, and she wonders how they could even find this planet. Goku says that he can contact King Kai, who he has feeling will know the planet's whereabouts.
"
Destination Namek,243 (DBZ 49),"The cover of this chapter shows Yajirobe, Master Roshi, Bulma, Krillin, Gohan, Goku, and Kami above them. All except Kami and Yajirobe are pointing the same direction.
 Goku asks Kaiō if he knows and he says that of course he knows, that’s why he’s called Kaiō. Kame-Sen’nin is amazed how even they can hear Kaiō. Goku asks to tell everyone, since they can apparently all hear him. But first Kaiō wants to say that they’ve all done well and Goku says how shocked he was that the Kaiō-Ken didn’t work so well. Kaiō says he miscalculated the strength of that Saiyan named Vegeta. Kame-Sen’nin asks what they’re talking about and Kuririn says he’ll tell him the details later. Kaiō then gets out a book and starts looking for the exact position of Planet Namek. In Earth terms, it’s 9045YX from the direction of SU83. Bulma freaks out when she hears 9045YX and tells Kame-Sen’nin to take the wheel while she does some calculations.
 Kaiō tells them that Planet Namek once was a beautiful planet, but then there was some unusual weather and the people began dying out. There should still be some survivors, though. Kuririn can’t believe it and Yajirobe thinks it’s hopeless. But that was a long time ago and Kaiō gets confused, and says he’ll know if he tries looking up what the state of the planet is now. Karin realizes God must have been the last one and he must have escaped to Earth. He also notes that God had forgotten all this, so he must have lost his memory. “He was quite a kid, with a sad past…” Yajirobe asks why those Namekians just didn’t wish away the unusual weather with their Dragon Balls and Kame-Sen’nin tells him the Dragon Balls can’t grant a wish that exceeds the strength of their creator. Even Shenlong couldn’t handle the Saiyan. Yajirobe thinks the Dragon Balls are worthless then.
 Kaiō yells at them with the news that there are still some Namekians on the planet! A mere hundred, but they’re prospering again! Everyone’s excited, though Yajirobe doesn’t like the thought of a hundred more people who look like God. “Originally the Namekians were a very peaceful race. Like your Earth’s God was. Perhaps before he became God, he met up with some Earthlings, and their influence brought forth Piccolo Daimaō.” Yajirobe agrees that there are lots of stingy people here. Kame-Sen’nin thinks the possibility of them bringing everyone back has increased. Bulma says they’re all really naive; even if they know where Planet Namek is, how will they get there? Kuririn says with a space ship, of course.
 She says they’re still so naive. “Even if we used a space ship containing the greatest engine Dad’s ever built, do you have any idea how long it would take to arrive on Planet Namek?” She knows: 4,339 years and three months, which even Kaiō is surprised to hear. Kuririn suggests they use a Saiyan spaceship. Kame-Sen’nin says the Saiyan left with it, but Kuririn says the ship of the Saiyan who died must still be around. Goku adds that his older brother also has a ship still here, but then adds it’s all broken. Bulma says that if there’s still one, they can probably analyze it and use it somehow. Kame-Sen’nin says it’s probably in East City, the first place they destroyed. They’ll have to search for it immediately afterwards.
 Kuririn remembers that he has the remote control Vegeta had used to call his space ship. Bulma takes it and thinks this all really is possible, and everyone starts celebrating. The next day, at West City’s hospital… Goku is all bandaged up and lying in a hospital bed, saying he won’t be healed for four months. Karin says not to worry, as there’ll be new senzu in one month. Kuririn and Gohan are lucky and only have to stay in the hospital for three days, and Kuririn says Goku looks like a mummy. Yajirobe is pissed that he’s not a patient and Karin says he only wants to be so he can get hospital food. Kuririn then mentions that when Yajirobe thought he was done for, he apologized and tried to join sides with the Saiyan, and Karin laughs as Yajirobe gets pissed. Gyūmaō is happy that everyone is okay and will be coming back to life, and then Bulma bursts into the room and says to watch the TV.
 A guy on the news is reporting that they’ve discovered this round object among the ruins of East City. He says it seems to have come from space and they’re able to ride in it. They all watch, although Goku can’t see from his position. There were originally two, but one suddenly flew away. Kame-Sen’nin says the scholars have already found it, but Bulma decides to use the remote control Kuririn gave her. She starts pressing the buttons and they watch on the TV as… it explodes. Everyone freaks out and Bulma thinks she must’ve hit the self-destruct switch. Kuririn faints and Goku thinks about how Kinto-Un won’t work. Bulma yells at Kuririn about the strange remote control and he says she was just rashly pressing buttons. Mister Popo suddenly appears outside the hospital window and the sight of him scares the Hell out of Bulma. Kuririn of course recognizes him, and Mister Popo says, “Someone come. There is a spaceship.”
"
The Mysterious Spaceship,244 (DBZ 50),"The cover of this chapter shows Mr. Popo and Bulma looking up at an old spaceship.
 Kuririn asks if there really is a space ship and Mister Popo says probably. Goku explains that Mister Popo lives with God, and served under all the previous Gods as well. Kuririn asks what he means “probably”, and Mister Popo says there’s probably a spaceship, but he doesn’t really know. So he wants someone to come with him to investigate. Kuririn looks to Bulma, but she doesn’t think it looks safe to go with Mister Popo on his flying carpet. After some encouragement, Bulma climbs out the window and onto the carpet, telling Popo to be careful since she’s delicate. The carpet suddenly vanishes and the others wonder about this possible space ship.
 The magic carpet reappears in a windy canyon. “We’ve arrived. Get down.” Bulma asks where they are, saying this place is extremely cold. “Yunzabit Heights.” Bulma asks if this isn’t the ends of the Earth, as Mister Popo tries to remember which direction it’s in. He starts walking through the canyon and Bulma follows, saying he better not be planning anything sexual. And then they come to a big open spot with a… “thing”. It’s a big round “thing” with spiky legs holding it up and some other spiky things sticking out the top. Mister Popo asks if this is a space ship and Bulma goes over to investigate, thinking it seems like metal. Then she asks where this “thing” is from and what it is exactly.
 Mister Popo says God told him something very unusual about a hundred years ago. He said that when he was a kid, he used to live here in Yunzabit Heights. He had asked Mister Popo why there was no one else living at Yunzabit. It seemed God had hit his head and lost his memory. He also asked Mister Popo where his parents were, since all he found was a letter saying, “I’ll come later, please wait for me.” So he kept waiting for his parents, but they never came (we see a flashback of older God talking to Mister Popo about all of this).
 God says he waited there until someone came; it was harsh and the food wasn’t good. He waited for twenty, no, thirty years, until he finally gave up and left his house behind. Sometimes he looks and notices that it hasn’t changed a bit. Bulma interrupts and asks the meaning of all this and Mister Popo says he’s getting to the point. God had said that he tries to remember that strange house. He now knows there are many different worlds out there, but his house was truly different. It had four round legs, like an insect. The door didn’t even have a knob or key; you had to open it with language.
 Mister Popo tells Bulma the word was “Piccolo”. The bottom of the “thing” suddenly comes down from the round part, like a disc-type platform, and so they climb onto it and say “Piccolo” again. Bulma realizes this is God’s house. Now the disc is a part of the floor, and they’re inside. Basically it’s just a futuristic looking room, with a big seat behind a control panel. Mister Popo asks if this doesn’t look like a space ship and Bulma remembers that God was a Namekian, and he must’ve come here to escape the unusual weather. Mister Popo says he also heard what Kaiō had told everyone about that and it reminded him of what God had told him about this house. Mister Popo says his parents must’ve sent him here as a kid, to save him from the bad things on the planet.
 Bulma thinks there must’ve been something up if his parents didn’t escape with him; maybe they planned to come afterwards, but they died. Bulma looks around and is certain this must be a space ship, but wonders if they’ll be able to use it. She starts messing with the control panel looking for the main switch, but can’t seem to find it, and wonders if there’s a code certain she needs. Then she doesn’t think these buttons are switches, but sensors. Then she realizes that the whole ship must be voice activated like the entrance was. “Piccolo” doesn’t work, so she tries saying something else. “Move!! Can you hear me!? Fly!! Try flying!!”
 Bulma gives up and realizes you must need to speak in Namekian. She remembers the weird language God and Piccolo had been speaking at the Tenka’ichi Budōkai, and realizes that must have been Namekian. Mister Popo says he knows that language. “Piccolo” means “different world” in that language. Then Bulma remembers something about Piccolo Daimaō being referred to as “the Great Demon King of a different world”. She tells Mister Popo to tell it to fly, and he asks where. She says anywhere is good, like Jupiter or something, and Mister Popo gives it the command in Namekian! Almost instantly it takes off and they immediately reach Jupiter. They start celebrating and Mister Popo wipes a tear away at the thought of God coming back to life.
"
3... 2... 1... Lift Off!,245 (DBZ 51),"The cover depicts Bulma striking a pose while in her space suit. Behind her is a view of space.
 Back at Wukong Hospital, Bulma and Mr. Popo are explaining to everyone about Kami's spaceship. Mr. Popo explains that he can not come on the voyage with them as he has to look after the Lookout. Bulma is angry because Mr. Popo is the only one who knows the Namekian language, the language which the ship responds to. Mr. Popo tells her not to worry, he can teach the language. Irritated, Bulma says that she does not want to go alone. Master Roshi says he would like to go, but Bulma shouts that he would just add needless danger. Noting that Goku is in no condition to come, Bulma asks Krillin, who accepts. Gohan decides that he wants to come too. Chi-Chi is shocked and becomes angry when Gohan continues to say he wants to go. She begins to shout at him and insist that he stay home. In a rare defiant moment, Gohan yells at his mother to be quiet and says that he can fight too.
 Bulma, Dr. Brief, and his crew are seen working on Kami's ship, fixing it up and re-inputting the Namekian language.
 Ten days after Bulma told everyone about the spaceship, the crew assemble at Kame House where the ship is parked. Bulma has cut her hair so it would not get in the way of her space suit, and is visibly bothered when she sees Kuririn's casual clothes. Chi-Chi and Gyūmaō arrive with Gohan, who has been given a bowl-shaped haircut and dress in fancy clothes by his mother. Kuririn laughs and asks Gohan if it is really him, to which Gohan respond that his dad laughed too.
 The ship takes off and Gohan reveals that he has made his own clothes, based on Piccolo's outfit. Bulma changes into normal clothing and is still annoyed that she was the only one who had ""enthusiastically prepared for outer space.""
"
The Return of Vegeta,246 (DBZ 52),"The cover of this chapter shows Vegeta. A planet in space can be seen behind him.
 The voyage continues and Bulma wakes up from a nap. She has all kinds of magazines and trash from junk food all over the floor around her bed, and she stands up, complaining about how it’s the seventh day and she can’t take another twenty. She thinks she should make some long-term sleeping device or something. She notices Kuririn and Gohan are both sitting quietly doing image training. Finally Kuririn stops and catches his breath and says Gohan’s really strong, being Goku’s kid and having learned from Piccolo. Gohan says Kuririn has all kinds of techniques, though. Bulma says his head is good for filling with training.
 Bulma tells them they need to tidy up the place, since she’s a lady. Kuririn says she’s the one who’s made all this mess and they’ve actually been cleaning up after themselves, besides she did say she was bored… Bulma yells at him that they should be kind to a delicate lady such as herself. She stretches and then walks away, and Kuririn comments that a lady shouldn’t be strutting around in her underwear. Bulma, now sitting in the main seat, asks where this Vegeta guy ran off to, since the Saiyan planet is gone. Bulma then remembers how Son-kun’s brother had said they clear planets of their inhabitants and sell them to aliens. She wonders if he isn’t getting help from those aliens.
 Cui tells Vegeta about Frieza going to Namek (Full Color Comics version) Meanwhile, Vegeta’s space pod is now eighteen days from Earth, and it arrives at Planet Freeza No. 79. Two aliens wearing armor and scouters like the Saiyan are playing a game, when they hear an alarm beeping. They go over and check it, and wonder if it’s Freeza. But the ship arriving is round, so it’s a fighter. The signal must mean its Vegeta, but one of the guys thinks something must be wrong, as he didn’t give notice of his return. The other guy radios someone saying “This is the control room!! Vegeta-sama is now arriving!! Hurry and meet him!!” Elsewhere on the planet, some other guys watch his space pod crash down, but note that there’s only one and wonders about Nappa. They’re also only getting a small life reading from Vegeta, so they look inside and notice he’s hooked up to life support, so they rush him to the medical room.
 Vegeta is now naked in a healing pod and the guy attending the machine stops it and drains the fluid. Vegeta opens his eyes and steps out, and the guy tells him he couldn’t restore his tail, but Vegeta says it’ll come back eventually. Vegeta starts to get dressed and asks if Freeza is around. The guy says Freeza has left and mentions that Kewi said he should come to the training room. Vegeta says to tell Kewi he doesn’t take orders from him. The guy tells Vegeta he’s forgotten his scouter, but Vegeta tells him to keep it.
 Vegeta walks through the halls of the base, thinking of how this time he’ll take care of those Earthlings. Then he stops, and some scaly catfish-looking guy greets him and laughs about the hard time he’s had. He mentions both Raditz and Nappa being dead, and asks if the great invincible Saiyans have been hurt. “Go away, Kewi. I don’t have time to associate with the likes of you.” Kewi halts him and tells him that Freeza is pissed about their selfish actions, and Vegeta says he’s not even here. Kewi continues that Freeza is very lenient, and he’ll let Vegeta slide because of the great things he’s learned from him. Kewi says Freeza was so happy to learn that he may be able to attain eternal youth and life, on Planet Namek!
 Vegeta’s pissed that Freeza heard the conversation through his scouter. Kewi says that eternal life was also Vegeta’s desire and laughs that he should give it up, because afterwards Freeza will wipe out all of the Namekian people. Vegeta then rushes out of the hall and into his space pod. “I won’t allow that…!!! That’s mine!!!” Meanwhile, on the thirty-fourth day, Bulma and everyone finally reach their destination, Planet Namek.

"Planet Namek, Cold and Dark",247 (DBZ 53),"The cover of this chapter shows Gohan, Bulma and Krillin standing in front of a panel showing Namek and the spaceship they used to get there. The cover art for this chapter is also featured in the artbooks Akira Toriyama - The World Special and Daizenshuu 1.
 The ship continues approaching Planet Namek, and Gohan and Kuririn actually get to put their seatbelts on this time as they enter the atmosphere. They land kind of hard, but it’s a successful landing nonetheless. Bulma starts preparing some special masks to breathe in the atmosphere here, but Kuririn and Gohan are already outside the ship, breathing just fine. They talk about this being Piccolo’s home planet, until Bulma comes out and yells at them for just coming out here without thinking. She pulls out the Dragon Radar to start searching for the Dragon Balls and Kuririn whispers to Gohan that she seems angry again. Bulma then gets excited that the Dragon Radar is detecting the Dragon Balls here as well.
 Kuririn and Bulma start dancing and celebrating, but then Gohan interrupts them. He feels a strong ki over that way, a bunch of them. Kuririn then notices it too and wonders what’s going on. Bulma says there’s nothing to worry about, it’s just the Namekians. Kuririn says they feel evil, but Bulma says Kaiō said they’re all peaceful. The radar says there’s four Dragon Balls gathered, not even in that direction. Bulma thinks they should meet the Namekians and Kuririn laughs about being worried over nothing. But then something suddenly bursts through the air and Kuririn yells out that it’s a Saiyan space ship.
 Bulma freaks out and Kuririn tells Gohan to lower his ki. Kuririn says it must be Vegeta and Gohan can’t believe his injuries are already healed. Bulma says they have to go back to Earth, but Kuririn tells her to go back by herself; they need to stay here and gather the Dragon Balls. Bulma says she’ll contact Kame-Sen’nin and then come back in two months with Goku. They don’t particularly like the idea of two months. Meanwhile, Vegeta has emerged from his ship, not about to let that bastard Freeza get the Dragon Balls. Freeza’s probably found out about his mutiny by now and probably plans to kill him. Vegeta doubts he can beat Freeza, though it won’t matter once he’s been granted eternal life by the Dragon Balls.
 Frieza, Dodoria and Zarbon's first appearance He’s brought a scouter after all and he uses it to find Freeza. Vegeta finds out where he is, and that he’s brought Zarbon and Dodoria with him, then flies off. Back on Earth, at Kame House, Kame-Sen’nin picks up the phone, and Bulma tells him the situation. She says to tell Goku and everyone about this, except for Chi-Chi. Suddenly they all spot a second space pod like Vegeta’s crash down somewhere. Elsewhere on the planet, in a village, some Namekians are lying on the ground dead. There’s a bunch of various kinds of aliens standing around, all dressed in armor like the Saiyan had, and one comes out of a house carrying the Three-Star Ball.
 A tiny little effeminate guy floating in a pod thing says they only have three left. He is surrounded by a long-haired pretty boy holding the Five-Star Ball and Two-Star Ball and a big fat ugly guy holding the Seven-Star Ball. The little guy tells the fat guy to hold onto the Three-Star Ball, addressing him as “Dodoria-san” and says that Vegeta is surely after these. The pretty boy calls the little guy Freeza, saying that Kewi has arrived and is pursuing Vegeta. The pretty boy continues that those must be the two large powers that just arrived. Just before them, two large powers appeared but suddenly vanished. Freeza says the only problem should be dealing with Vegeta, though. The pretty boy says Kewi’s after him, and those two have hated each other from the start. Kewi’s ship has crashed down right next to Vegeta’s and he checks his scouter and says they’re about even in battle power. Nevertheless, he’ll win. “I won’t let you get away, Vegeta! I, Kewi-sama, will finish you off…!”
"
The Mysterious Strangers,248 (DBZ 54),"The cover of this chapter shows various characters, items, and writing all inside little square panels. This include Zarbon, a Namekian Dragon Ball, Dodoria, Frieza, Cui, Gohan, Krillin, Bulma, and Vegeta.
 Bulma thinks this is all terrible and Kuririn says there shouldn’t be anymore Saiyan. Meanwhile, Kewi finds Vegeta’s location with his scouter. As he flies off, he tells Vegeta through his scouter that Freeza has given him the okay to kill him. Vegeta is just standing on a cliff somewhere, though. “You make me laugh, Kewi. Do you really think you can kill me? I’m waiting, so hurry up and get here.” Kewi tells him to look at his scouter and he’ll see who the clear winner is. Vegeta just smirks.
 Back at the ship, Bulma says goodbye and good luck to Kuririn and Gohan, and that she’ll be back with Goku. Kuririn tells her to wait and tells Gohan they should go too. He doubts the bad guys have a Dragon Radar, but then Bulma brings up when Piccolo Daimaō killed Shenlong, implying Freeza might do that too. Then Gohan says someone’s coming, but their ki is too weak to be Vegeta. Two of Freeza’s men are nearby, saying this is the area where the readings were before they disappeared, and one guy wonders if it’s just some Namekians. Kuririn thinks they must be Namekians, but Bulma screams it’s not once they pop out into view. The two scouts notice they’re not Namekians either, but their orders were to kill everyone on this planet, so…
 Kuririn notices they have clothes like the Saiyan, but they’re definitely not Saiyan. He doesn’t know what’s going on, but he doesn’t like it. Bulma says that judging by their faces, they can’t be friendly. The two scouts float into the air and laugh about their pathetic battle powers. Kuririn tells Gohan to gather his ki. One of the guys says it wouldn’t be any fun if they got away, so first he’ll destroy their space ship. He has a little gun hooked up to his hand and shoots a big beam through the ship. The scouts laugh about this and Kuririn tells Gohan to open his ki, since these guys are no match for them. The scouts overhear this and begin laughing hysterically.
 Kuririn and Gohan begin powering up and the guys’ scouters go crazy. Kuririn and Gohan suddenly vanish and appear mid-air in front of the scouts. Gohan punches one in the face and Kuririn kicks the other in the face. Both guys go flying off into the distance, landing in the water. Kuririn says they did nice and Bulma screams that it wasn’t nice at all. Elsewhere, the pretty boy picks up something on his scouter and Freeza asks him what’s wrong, addressing him as “Zarbon-san”. Zarbon says the people they went to scout out seemed like nothing, but then their battle powers suddenly skyrocketed and they defeated the two they sent on reconnaissance, but then their readings disappeared again.
 Freeza wonders if it’s Vegeta or something, but Zarbon says it isn’t, the readings were both about 1,500. Freeza thinks that next time they should be sure to wipe them out. Meanwhile, Bulma cries about the wreckage of the ship and how she can’t go back to Earth now. Kuririn thinks they should leave this spot, because even stronger guys are on their way. Gohan agrees, and says they’re definitely not Namekians, but allies of Vegeta’s it seems. Gohan also says that surely the Namekians will help them fix the ship, and so she relents. Elsewhere, Vegeta and Kewi are now staring each other down. Kewi says they’re rivals, but it all ends here. Vegeta says he’s going to show him something good he picked up while on Earth. Kewi asks if it’s speed for escaping, but Vegeta says, “It’s battle power control!!!!”

Vegeta's True Power,249 (DBZ 55),"Translated chapter cover The chapter cover art features those currently on Namek searching for the Dragon Balls, such as Frieza, Krillin, Gohan and Vegeta, as well as a hospitalized Goku. They are all drawn in Chibi style, and each of the characters are holding signs which display their names and provide a brief summary of current events. Thus, the cover functions as a recap.
 Cui learns that Vegeta can now control his Power Level, and that he has become significantly stronger than before. The spike in power causes Cui's and Zarbon's scouters to explode at the same time. Like Cui, Frieza realizes Vegeta can control his power level and remarks that the increase is hardly a surprise, as Vegeta's duties as a soldier keep him on the front lines.
 Cui is surprised by Vegeta's newly increased power level Vegeta executes Cui Cui realizes he can not defeat Vegeta and pleads for his life, suggesting he and Vegeta team up. When this does not work, Cui begins preparing a Ki Blast and pretends to see Frieza approaching, causing Vegeta to turn around and drop his guard. Cui uses this opportunity to strike, however, Vegeta avoids the blasts easily. Shocked, Cui flees for his life but is killed by Vegeta's Dirty Fireworks. Frieza brushes this off as nothing to be concerned over, and he and his men begin searching for the fifth Namekian Dragon Ball.
 Bulma, Krillin, and Gohan find a cave to take shelter in. When, Frieza's men begin to approach them, Krillin panics and suggests the three take cover.
"
Goku Returns! Again!,250 (DBZ 56),"The cover shows Goku looking up at the reader smiling.
 Bulma thinks this is all terrible and Kuririn says there shouldn’t be anymore Saiyan. Meanwhile, Kewi The three of them hurry inside the cave, and Kuririn thinks they must be on the same side as those two from before. Kuririn wonders if they’ve been found, as they all press up against the cave walls, but the group flies right past the cave. Bulma is relieved they weren’t after them, but wonders what they’re doing instead. Kuririn and Gohan suddenly get a bad feeling, and Kuririn asks Bulma-san to confirm it with the Dragon Radar. They wonder if the group had the four Dragon Balls they saw earlier… and they do.
 Kuririn asks Gohan if he noticed the second guy from the front (which was Freeza), and Gohan did, saying he felt an incredible amount of strength. Kuririn says he’s much worse than Vegeta and he couldn’t even move in that instant because of him. The others were all awesome, but he was much different. Bulma can’t believe there are people stronger than Vegeta, and Kuririn says they’re probably his allies, since they have the same outfits. Bulma then notices on the radar that they’re headed straight for another Dragon Ball. They think they must have a radar, too.
 That location is about fourteen kilometers from them and Gohan says it’s the place where Kuririn had felt the Namekians before. Kuririn says he’s going there and Gohan says he will go with him. Bulma can’t believe they’re just going to leave her here alone, and Kuririn tells her it’s safer here. She then agrees and says she’ll make a house capsule. Kuririn asks her to contact Muten Roshi, and she tells them to be careful. Kuririn says they need to hurry while holding back as much ki as possible, and they dash off.
 Back on Earth at the hospital, Goku is still all bandaged up and sitting on the floor doing sit-ups. The doctor comes in with a nurse and says he’s overdoing it again and tells Goku he still can’t leave the hospital. The doctor says he doesn’t believe this nonsense about fighting aliens as he helps him back into bed. The doctor asks about his wife and Goku says she got bored and went shopping. Then Kame-Sen’nin walks in the door and notices Chi-Chi’s not here. He has brought a sponge cake as a sympathy present. He tells Goku he got a message from Bulma two hours ago, as he grabs the nurse’s ass. She screams, and Kame-Sen’nin asks if he did something, since he doesn’t know what he’s doing sometimes at his age.
 Kame-Sen’nin tells Goku that Bulma and co. arrived on Planet Namek, but they weren’t the only ones who arrived. Vegeta is also there. Goku freaks out and Kame-Sen’nin says that’s not all, Umigame radioed him on the way here that they received a new message from Bulma. There are about ten other people besides Vegeta on Planet Namek, seemingly on the same side as him. They also broke their space ship so they can’t return to Earth. And one of them has a ki much greater than Vegeta’s. Goku can’t believe all this. Yajirobe then comes in the room with a bag of seven senzu from Karin. Goku says he has great timing and asks to eat one right now. The doctor gets pissed about him giving weird things to a patient.
 Goku eats it, flips out of bed, busts out of his bandages, and then gets changed into his usual dougi. He declares he’s going to Planet Namek and tells Yajirobe he’ll need the remaining senzu as well. Kame-Sen’nin asks how he plans to get to Planet Namek and Goku says Bulma’s father offered to make him a space ship as a sympathy gift. Not like God’s, but from the two remaining space ships here on Earth (his older brother’s, and the one Goku had used as a baby). Raditz’s ship exploded, but his own was okay, with some modifications. Goku says he can make it to Planet Namek in six days, then hops out the window and calls for Kinto-Un (the nurse and doctor freak out), saying he’s going to help. Yajirobe asks what he meant by “going to help”, and Kame-Sen’nin explains it all. Yajirobe doesn’t like his odds, as Goku flies along, thinking about someone being even stronger than Vegeta.
"
Son Goku's Spaceship,251 (DBZ 57),"The cover shows Goku in the foreground with the Capsule Corporation spaceship in the background.
 Goku approaches Capsule Corp, hops off Kinto-Un, and starts walking around outside, wondering where it is. He spots Bulma’s Mom watering flowers and she asks Goku how he’s doing. He asks her where Bulma’s Dad is, and she says he’s still working on the space ship. Bulma’s Mom grabs Goku by the arm and walks with him, saying how little Goku has grown up so nicely, and they should go on a date after he defeats that Saiyan. They finally arrive at the space ship and Dr. Brief is surprised he’s already all fixed up.
 Goku asks if it isn’t already complete, since it looks good enough to him. Dr. Brief steps out and says he needs a bit more time, and asks Goku to come in. Bulma’s Mom then leaves and says she’ll go fetch him a drink or something, as well as Puar and Oolong. Goku steps inside and says it’s huge, and Dr. Brief says it’s just as he requested. Goku thinks it’s perfect for training and Dr. Brief notes that Saiyan science is impressive. Goku asks him if he’s finished the artificial gravity stuff, and he says he has. Dr. Brief brings him over to a panel in the center and says this is the artificial gravity switch, and this one is the controller; it can go up to 100G. Dr. Brief tells him it’s crazy, though. If he weighs about sixty kilograms, at 100G he’ll weigh six thousand kilograms, or six tons!
 Goku says it’ll be alright, because he can’t beat the Saiyan without it. Goku asks if it still can’t fly. Dr. Brief says it can and that all of the data has been inputted, so all Goku has to do is press the switch and he’ll arrive at Planet Namek. Dr. Brief then points down some stairs, and says clothes, a bathroom, a kitchen, and a bedroom are all down there. Goku asks what the holdup is then. “I still haven’t decided where to put the stereo speakers.” Goku freaks out that that’s all and says he needs to leave right away. Dr. Brief asks if he’s just going to give up the stereo and Goku explains that they got a message from Bulma: the three of them arrived on Planet Namek okay, but then so did the Saiyan from before, and some of his allies. On top of that, their space ship’s broken!
 Dr. Brief says that’s awful, and Goku says to hurry and tell him how to take off, as Dr. Brief still asks if it’s really okay without the stereo. Goku sits down in the pilot seat and presses the button, and the ship blasts off into the sky. Dr. Brief looks up at it from the ground, impressed that it really flew. Puar and Oolong come out there wondering what all the racket is and see the space ship flying away. Dr. Brief says Goku just left, and Oolong thinks he was pretty rude, but Puar is worried that something happened. Meanwhile, Goku is already pretty far from Earth and realizes it’s really dark here in space, and wonders if it’s night. He decides he needs to start training right away. Kaiō’s place was 10G, so he decides to start at 20G. He walks around, and then starts doing some push-ups and sit-ups.
 Back on Namek, Kuririn and Gohan continue dashing towards their destination. Kuririn says they’re close, so they need to completely hide their ki and walk the rest of the way. They walk up a small cliff, crouch down, and look down from it at a bunch of houses that look just like their space ship. They notice a group of guys down there, and especially take notice of Freeza, Zarbon, and Dodoria. Kuririn points out that Dodoria and Zarbon have Dragon Balls, huge Dragon Balls. Dodoria suddenly gets a small reading on his scouter and looks up at the cliff, but the signal disappears. He thinks it must be a small animal or a bug. A guy comes out of one of the houses and says he’s found only five of them remaining, the rest are gone it seems. Kuririn notices the Namekians and how they look just like Piccolo and God.
"
Namekian Fear,252 (DBZ 58),"The cover shows Goku doing one handed push ups inside the Capsule Corporation spaceship.
 Krillin and Gohan look down from a cliff at a Namekian village where Frieza and his soldiers are attempting to claim the village's Namekian Dragon Ball. Moori, the village's elder, attempts to fool Frieza by speaking in the Namekian's native language, but Frieza already knows that Namekians are entirely capable of speaking English. Moori continuously denies knowing the Dragon Ball's whereabouts but Frieza tells how another village elder had already told him that every village has possession of a Dragon Ball. The elder told him only one deemed worthy by all seven elders would be allowed to claim the Dragon Balls. When that elder had refused to give up the Dragon Ball, Frieza had killed him but was still able to pinpoint the Dragon Ball of that village. Frieza then informs Moori and the other village Namekians that the other three Dragon Balls were easy to obtain as everyone was ""happy"" to oblige. Meanwhile, Vegeta hears of all of this via his scouter. Moori and the other villagers deny this, and accuse Frieza of having killed those villagers too. Frieza then says that they obliged quickly when he did ""this"", before ordering Zarbon to kill all the villagers besides Moori and the child Namekians, which he follows happily. Angered, Moori still refuses to cede his Dragon Ball to Frieza. Frieza threatens to kill the children too, which surprises Moori, who is sickened anyone would murder children. From atop the cliff, Gohan becomes extremely angered. Just then, however, three young Namekians fly into the village.
"
Showdown!,253 (DBZ 59),"Frieza is seen standing in the middle of the cover.
 The three young Namekians come into the village, pissed, and they notice the two older men dead. One man says he’d had a bad feeling and Freeza says they’ve taken a break from work to come get killed. Another of the men says he’d heard a rumor that someone was coming to the villages and taking the Dragon Balls, so it must be true. The third man gets pissed at them stomping on Namek’s peace. The elder tells them to be careful, but please fight. Freeza asks Dodoria what their battle powers are. He checks and says they’re each about 1,000; no match for them. The elder realizes those devices are how they’re able to find the small villages and people on this vast planet.
 Three Namekian warriors appear The random henchman laugh about them being only 1,000, but Kuririn and Gohan notice they’re actually holding back their ki. The henchman all rush at them, but then the men start powering up. One of the Namekians kicks a henchman into a random mountain thing. The other Namekian punches one another henchmen hard in the face, probably breaking his neck, and the third Namekian blasts another guy and sends him flying over towards Zarbon. Zarbon kicks him away into the ocean, and asks Dodoria if they’re really only at 1,000. Dodoria checks and says they have somehow gone up to 3,000 now. The Namekian men keep beating up all the henchmen, as Kuririn and Gohan silently cheer them on from atop the cliff.
 Freeza notes that they are able to control their battle powers. The elder starts thinking about those devices again, and tells the two kids to get away. Dodoria sets down his two Dragon Balls and asks Freeza if he can get rid of those three, who tells him to do as he likes. The elder suddenly fires a little ki blast at Dodoria’s scouter and blows it up. Dodoria laughs and says an attack like that won’t defeat him. The elder then jumps up into the air and starts firing more ki blasts down, destroying the scouters of all the defeated henchmen as well. Zarbon realizes he’s targeting the scouters and Dodoria screams that he’ll kill them all.
"
Ten Seconds of Death,254 (DBZ 60),"The cover shows Kami, Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu, Yamcha and Piccolo standing in a line with Halos over their heads.
 Zarbon yells out that the target is the scouters, and Gohan notes that that’s the thing that detects opponent’s strength and location. Kuririn realizes that it wasn’t that they had a way to find the location of the Dragon Balls, but they were searching out the Namekians themselves with the scouters. Dodoria gets pissed and threatens to kill them all, then flies up into the air after the elder. Freeza yells at him to wait and kill the three young ones first. Dodoria comes back to the ground and faces them, and tells them it should only take ten seconds to take care of them. But one of the Namekians says he thinks the three of them can stand their ground against him.
 Dodoria brutally kills a Namekian “You think you can hold your own against me, you say? What a great joke!” Dodoria suddenly appears behind one of them and puts his arm straight through his chest. He pulls it out and fires a huge mouth blast at the next Namekian. Finally he swipes at last Namekian, but he jumps up into the air and starts running away. Dodoria chases after him, so he turns around and throws a two-handed ki blast at Dodoria. There’s a giant explosion and the man thinks he’s won, but when the smoke clears Dodoria is unharmed. Dodoria flies straight at him and headbutts him straight into a hillside, killing him. Freeza tells the elder he must realize it’s pointless to defy him any further and asks him to come down. The elder hesitates a bit, but finally comes back down to the ground and Freeza’s glad he’s being a little more obedient.
 Dodoria viciously kills another Namekian “You’ve broken our very important scouters. Don’t you think you should apologize and hand over the Dragon Ball? You probably already know how we work, right? So, if you’re stubborn, the children will die next.” The elder relents, so long as they promise to leave the children out of this. Kuririn asks Gohan if he notices a weird ki rising; it’s not extreme, but it’s more than a match for them. The elder then gives the Four-Star Ball over to one of the henchman and Freeza asks him to tell them where the other two Dragon Balls are. The elder refuses to sell out the other Namekians and Freeza says he’ll just have to die, along with the children. The elder freaks out at hearing this, when Dodoria suddenly attacks him.

 The elder goes flying back a bit, with little damage. He tells Freeza this isn’t what he promised; he said he’d leave after he had the Dragon Ball. “But without all seven Dragon Balls, there’s no point, right? Since you’ve broken our scouters, you should tell us the location of the remaining two Dragon Balls.” The elder says he should’ve said so, but he would still rather die than tell them. Freeza says he’ll have to grant that wish, then. Zarbon asks if they can really search for the Dragon Balls without scouters and Freeza tells him they’re sure to find something if they search for the other villages or Namekians. For now, Freeza wants these three killed.
 Kuririn is pissed and the elder tells the two kids to run away. Then the elder stands up and yells, “I’ll show you the pride of the Namekians!!!!” Freeza then fires a small blast towards the elder, but it goes over his shoulder and hits one of the kids. The other kid yells out about Cargo dying, as Gohan starts to get really pissed. Dodoria then grabs the elder, gets him in a headlock, and breaks his neck. He laughs and drops the elder to the ground. Kuririn tells Gohan he needs to hold back, since there’s nothing they can do. The remaining kid then cries and tries to run away, so Dodoria chases after, then appears in front of the kid.
 Dodoria prepares to attack him, and then Gohan stands up and screams, “Stooooop!!!!!” Gohan takes to the air, and Freeza and Zarbon look toward him. Dodoria wonders where the person is, and then Gohan suddenly flies in and kicks him in the face, knocking his head through a house. Kuririn thinks he’s an idiot and goes in to help also, as Dodoria recovers and asks who the Hell he is. Gohan says he’s going to beat him up, and Dodoria starts to stand up, when Kuririn flies in with another kick to the face. Kuririn then grabs the kid and tells Gohan they need to run away, and so the three of them fly off. Freeza says they aren’t Namekians. Dodoria gets up again, pissed, and Freeza yells at him to go chase and catch them, so he flies off as well. Kuririn tells Gohan to speed up, because if they’re caught, it’s all over. And then Dodoria has already nearly caught up to them, as Freeza wonders who those two were.

 Dodoria has nearly caught up, and Gohan thinks they should land and fight him. Kuririn says they are no match for him at all and they need to just keep flying. Kuririn is pissed and thinks about how he needs to give this kid to Gohan, and then suddenly gets an idea, as Dodoria gets even closer. He throws the kid over to Gohan. Kuririn yells at Gohan not to look in his direction and close his eyes. Kuririn then puts his fingers to his face, turns around towards Dodoria and says “Take THIS…!!!!! Taiyō-Ken!!!!!” Dodoria is suddenly blinded and Kuririn speeds up to catch up to Gohan and the kid, and says they should hurry and hide while they have the chance.
 Dodoria's Maximum Buster The three of them then land at the foot of a nearby mountain, as Dodoria starts to regain his sight. He can not find them, and gets pissed. He then starts flying in circles around the area, screaming at them to show themselves. Gohan tells the kid it will be okay, he can not find them since that elder broke all of the scouters. Dodoria gets pissed about trying to find such small guys in such a big area, and then decides he will just blow everything up. He flies straight up into the air, and Gohan thinks he is given up and left. Kuririn is worried, however. Dodoria stops way up high with a good vantage point and fires a huge blast straight down. All of the little surrounding islands are blown up, leaving nothing but ocean. Dodoria remembers Freeza said to bring them back, but thinks it is okay if they have escaped. He says he did not know their “true form”, and thinks they were not normal. Meanwhile, everyone is still alive up in the air behind Dodoria. Dodoria then flies off, and they are all relieved. Kuririn says they should go back to Bulma's location for now, and asks the kid if he can fly. He says he can, and thanks Kuririn for saving him. Kuririn says to save his thanks for Gohan, since he would thought it was too dangerous. But Gohan says if Kuririn were not there, they would have both died. Kuririn says they should head back now, and Gohan remembers where Bulma is. Dodoria, meanwhile, wonders about finding the Dragon Balls without a scouter as he flies along, when suddenly, he is knocked straight down into the water. He makes his way back up to the surface and climbs ashore, only to find Vegeta standing in front of him.
"
Vegeta vs. Dodoria,257 (DBZ 63),"The cover shows Dodoria facing Vegeta on Namek.
 Dodoria climbs ashore, pissed that it was Vegeta who surprise attacked him. Vegeta says that he and Zarbon are always with Freeza, and he's been waiting for him to get separated. Dodoria laughs and tells him to hand over his scouter and get lost. Vegeta realizes all of their scouters are gone and laughs. They didn't know when he was near, and so his chance has finally come around. He says he only took this scouter to see how many days it would take to get to Namek, so if Dodoria wants it... Vegeta takes it off and drops it to the ground, and Dodoria says he must be scared; he might be able to save Vegeta's life if his luck is good. But then Vegeta smirks and steps on the scouter. Dodoria freaks out and asks why, and Vegeta says because he no longer has any use for it.
 Vegeta fires his Finish Blaster Dodoria says he wants to find the Dragon Balls too, right, so wouldn't he need it to find the locations of the Namekians or Freeza? Vegeta says he learned on Earth how to tell an enemy's location and strength without a scouter. It's a simple thing to do, Vegeta continues, and you can not tell the power of people like Freeza with just your eyes. ""But then, up until now, I've been like that, too."" Dodoria realizes those little runts from before must've been Earthlings, and Vegeta's teamed up with them. Vegeta doubts the Earthlings could be here, but Dodoria says it doesn't matter, and says he'll kill Vegeta.
 Vegeta asks what he's scared of, and then realizes he must've noticed how much stronger than Kewi he was during their fight. Vegeta asks about his own battle power and Dodoria yells out that it was a mistake and the scouter was malfunctioning. Dodoria then gets really pissed and fires a whole bunch of blasts at Vegeta, blowing up the whole area. But then Vegeta appears behind Dodoria and says that technique seems to be useless. Dodoria swings backward to punch Vegeta, but Vegeta catches his arm. Dodoria kicks at him but Vegeta swings around and grabs the other arm, holding both of Dodoria's arms behind him now. Vegeta tells him he's not strong enough to fight a Saiyan, and explains that he received a huge power up from being at the brink of death on Earth. ""That's the fighting race, the Saiyan!!!""
 Vegeta's Finish Blaster kills Dodoria Vegeta tells Dodoria he's neglected that, and tells him to die and be reborn. ""W-wait, Vegeta!! I-if you let me go right now, I’ll tell you a secret...!! About your Saiyan planet, Planet Vegeta...!!"" Vegeta then lets him go and says to tell him his secret about Planet Vegeta. Dodoria says he probably will kill him after he tells him, and Vegeta says he'll kill him right now if he doesn’t. Dodoria says it wasn't a meteorite that had destroyed their planet. Freeza felt the Saiyan were becoming too troublesome in their great numbers, and if too many of them got too strong like Vegeta, they'd stop being so obedient and obeying orders. Thus, Freeza took it upon himself to destroy Planet Vegeta himself.
 Dodoria tells Vegeta he should be thankful, though. Since he was a prince and had genius abilities, Freeza felt he could use him, and waited until Vegeta was gone from the planet to destroy it. Vegeta remains silent, and Dodoria laughs that it must've been a big shock, and says this is why he likes being on Freeza's side. ""Don't misunderstand me, Dodoria. I don't care about my planet or allies or parents or anything... I'm just angry for myself because of you using me as a brat without having known that...!"" Dodoria freaks out and starts to fly away. But Vegeta fires a huge blast up at him with one hand, killing him. ""Freeza fears the endless potential of the Saiyan..!"" says Vegeta, as Goku continues doing push-ups on his ship.
"
Hide and Seek,258 (DBZ 64),"The cover of this chapter shows Goku kicking. Two panels can be seen behind him showing Gohan, Krillin and Dende in one and Vegeta in the other.
 Vegeta marvels over his power at being able to kill Dodoria now and thinks his time on Earth really wasn’t a waste. But then he wonders what Dodoria had said about chasing Earthlings, and remembers feeling two large powers a ways off earlier. Vegeta decides that he should go investigate, since he can’t have anyone interfering, and flies off. Meanwhile, Gohan, Kuririn, and the kid keep flying towards the cave where Bulma is, but then they feel something really fast coming. They hurry and swoop down to an island and hide, and Kuririn wonders how that bastard knows where they are without that device. Vegeta then flies into the area, and says the two powers have vanished, and looks around some more.
 Gohan looks up and points out to Kuririn that Vegeta is up there, and they all duck and freak out. Vegeta then moves out of their line of sight, and they’re relieved he’s still searching for them. Kuririn wonders how he could find them without a scouter, as Vegeta gets pissed and wonders if he was mistaken. He thinks he still hasn’t mastered this “power seeking technique” yet, and wishes he had not broken his scouter after all. Then he feels something, as Kuririn realizes he must be able to feel ki. Kuririn freaks out, because even if they hide their ki, there is still this kid's small ki. Vegeta does feel a small power, and says it’s no mistake this time. Vegeta then flies in towards them and Kuririn thinks it’s all over.
 But then a giant fish jumps out of the water, and Vegeta thinks that’s who it was. He decides to go find the remaining two Dragon Balls… no, just one, so Freeza won’t be able to get all seven. Then he will take Freeza's five, he says to himself as he flies off. Kuririn and Gohan relax and try to catch their breath. Kuririn says he thought it was all over, but for now they should go back to Bulma's place. He really wants to rest even though he didn’t fight. They all hop across to another island, and they walk along until they come to Bulma’s cave. She’s not in the opening, so they decide to go into the cave and see.
 They soon find a huge capsule house in the back of the cave, and Bulma comes out and yells at them for being all carefree out there and leaving a young girl in here by herself. Then she spots the “tiny Piccolo-looking kid” and asks if he is a Namekian. She asks why he is here, and Kuririn says they should go inside first. And then Bulma remembers to tell them that she got a great message from Goku: he will be here in six days! She explains how he got the ship, and that he’s getting incredible training along the way here. They all get excited and dance around, as Goku continues training in his ship.
"
The Sixth Dragon Ball,259 (DBZ 65),"The cover of this chapter shows Frieza standing over Dende with Namekian Dragon Balls floating around.
 Vegeta is flying along and he feels about twenty great powers, which is unmistakably a Namekian village. So, it should have a Dragon Ball. Vegeta speeds up and laughs about how Freeza doesn’t have scouters, and he can get away with all of this without them knowing a thing. He arrives at the village and realizes that Freeza must not have come here yet if there are still villagers alive. The villagers are all peacefully farming the land and working, as Vegeta lands in the middle of the village. They all take notice of the alien, and Vegeta demands the elder come give him the Dragon Ball.
 A heavy old man says he’s the elder, and asks why he should give the Dragon Ball to him. Vegeta says to never mind that and just hand it over. The elder says he can’t give the Dragon Ball to him, since he feels evil within him. “Well then, die!” Meanwhile, back at the capsule house in the cave, everyone is sitting around relaxing, and apparently they’ve explained to Bulma what happened. Kuririn and Gohan are eating, but the kid won’t touch his food. Kuririn tells him to eat, but Bulma says to leave him alone, he’s probably upset about all the people in his village having been killed. “We don’t eat this sort of thing. We just drink water.” Kuririn says he must be joking, since he saw they were growing vegetables in the fields.
 The kid says those were young Ajissa trees. He explains that before the unusual weather started happening on Planet Namek, the planet was beautiful and overgrown with Ajissa trees. But then the Ajissa trees and all the Namekians nearly died out, so now, they’re trying to make the planet abundant with Ajissa trees again. Gohan then asks the kid what his name is. “Dende… Umm… Who are you guys?” Suddenly Kuririn and Gohan feel something and rush out of the cave. Bulma asks if someone’s coming again. But that’s not it; one-by-one, ki are disappearing says Kuririn, and Gohan realizes more Namekians are being killed. Kuririn says they know that ki… it’s Vegeta, terrorizing a village nearby.
 Kuririn gets pissed and says that until Goku arrives, they can’t be careless. It’s all over if Vegeta or that Freeza bastard receive eternal life from the Dragon Balls. Bulma says that if they find at least one, nobody else will have all seven. Gohan says that’s no good, because even if they did that, the bad guys would still continue to kill off all the Namekians. They start talking about how Goku can defeat Vegeta and stuff, but then Dende interrupts. “Please tell me who you are…! Where have you come from… How do you know about the Dragon Balls… Please save everyone on this planet!!”
 Meanwhile, Vegeta bashes in the skull of a Namekian, and everyone in the village is now dead, except the elder. He still won’t hand over the Dragon Balls, though, and Vegeta says he’s stubborn even to the end. Vegeta says he’ll just search for it himself, then blasts the elder with one hand and kills him. Kuririn tells Dende they came from Earth, where they also have Dragon Balls because of a Namekian there, and they need to use the Dragon Balls to return their dead friends to life. Bulma adds that if they make their wish, the Earth Dragon Balls will be revived. Dende then asks that they please take him to the Eldest. Meanwhile, Vegeta has finally found the Four-Star Ball.
"
The Last Dragon Ball,260 (DBZ 66),"The cover of this issue shows different panels with main characters inside them. Characters seen in these panels are Vegeta, Goku, Krillin, Gohan, Zarbon, Frieza, Bulma and Dende. The Namekian Dragon Balls are also visible.
 Frieza asks his men to find the Dragon Balls Vegeta tosses his Dragon Ball into the lake next to the village, so that nobody will know where to find it, except him. He then wonders what to do next. Freeza has five and is searching for the remaining one. Vegeta then flies off thinking. Meanwhile, Freeza, Zarbon, and the only remaining henchman are still waiting on Dodoria, thinking he’s still chasing those little guys. Freeza thinks Dodoria was an idiot, and they should just go search for the remaining two Dragon Balls. Zarbon and the other henchman will go look for the last two villages, and Freeza will go back to their ship with the five Dragon Balls they have so far. Zarbon and the henchman drop their Dragon Balls to the ground, then take to the air. Zarbon tells the other henchman to search that way, but notify him if he finds the village, so that he won’t get killed by the stronger Namekians. No matter what, they’ll return to the ship in three hours. Then they both fly off.
 Freeza thinks that Vegeta is probably already searching himself, and is sure to come after the Dragon Balls they already have. And when Vegeta does come, they’ll just take the two he has, and have all seven. Freeza lifts the five Dragon Balls off the ground telekinetically, and zooms off with them in his pod. Back at the cave, Bulma asks Dende about this Eldest, and Dende says he was the person who gave birth to all of the Namekians here. He was the only person who survived the unusual weather, and he repopulated the planet afterwards. “I’m the 108th child of the Eldest.” Bulma asks how he could’ve given birth if he was the only one, and Dende says by producing eggs from his mouth. Bulma says that’s really different, and thinks this Eldest must be a woman. Dende then asks what a “woman” is. Bulma asks if there aren’t two types of Namekians, man and woman, like his mother and father for example. Dende doesn’t understand this “two type” thing at all. Bulma thinks this is a boring planet if it doesn’t have men or women.
 Kuririn changes the subject and wants to know why they should go to see the Eldest (as Bulma says she’s glad she’s not a Namekian). “Ah! The people who attacked our village already have four Dragon Balls… And then, now you’ve said a lot of people are being killed in that direction, right?” Kuririn says yeah, it was probably Vegeta, and Gohan says there’s no one left, they’ve been wiped out. Dende says that means there’s hardly anyone remaining on this planet now. Kuririn says that Vegeta must have the Dragon Ball from the village he attacked, meaning there’s only one left. Kuririn asks if the last Dragon Ball is being held by the Eldest, and Dende says it is. Kuririn freaks out, because even though Freeza’s troops no longer have scouters, Vegeta can detect ki, and so he’ll probably be after the seventh Dragon Ball there. Dende cries and says they must hurry then, and Kuririn agrees, because they can’t let Freeza or Vegeta be granted eternal life. Kuririn says he’ll go, and asks Gohan to stay with Bulma. It’s dangerous if too many of them go.
 Kuririn asks Dende how long it would take them to get there walking, so as not to be noticed by Vegeta. Dende says it’s about thirty days walking, and Kuririn says that’s no good at all, so they’ll have to fly. They’ll just have to hide again if Vegeta notices them. So Dende and Kuririn fly off, and tell Bulma and Gohan to be careful. Kuririn thinks about how strong Freeza and Vegeta are along the way, and thinks they’ll just hide with the Eldest’s Dragon Ball for the five and a half days it will take Goku to get there. Speaking of whom, Goku is flying through space doing flips and throwing punches in his ship. He’s exhausted, but thinks he should move up to 30G now, when Kaiō-sama contacts him. He asks Goku if he’s in space, but remembers that he should be on his way to Planet Namek, and thinks it’ll be good if he finds the Dragon Balls there. Goku can’t believe Kaiō-sama didn’t know that, and says there’s bad stuff happening on Planet Namek. Kaiō-sama says to tell him later, he has good news first. He has guests here. There are four guests, and they’ve cleared Serpent Road in a much shorter time than Goku did. Four people he knows well. They’ve come here for stern training like Goku did. Tenshinhan, Chiaotzu, Piccolo, and Yamcha!
"
The Four Dead Heroes,261 (DBZ 67),"The cover of this chapter shows Vegeta facing off against Zarbon in midair.
 Goku thinks it’s awesome that everyone’s made it to Kaiō’s place. Yamcha then asks if he can talk to Goku, and Kaiō tells him to put his hand on his shoulder, and then speak. Yamcha tells Goku that when they came to the afterlife with God, he told them that Goku and the others are going to Piccolo’s home planet to return all of them to life. Goku thinks the four must be Yamcha, Tenshinhan… and then wonders if the third is Piccolo. Piccolo says it’s him, and notes that he’s only come here because his pride was damaged from Goku being stronger than him. Goku thinks the fourth must be God, but Yamcha tells him it’s Chiaotzu. His body was destroyed, but God restored him, and told them to come here to train. Goku’s glad to hear that, and Yamcha goes on about the gravity here giving them trouble.
 Goku understands, and says how on the way to Planet Namek, he’s receiving really really awesome gravity training. He’ll really need to make use of this training in five and a half days. Then Kaiō remembers him talking about his bad news, and tells Goku to explain it. “Since I was really injured, Kuririn, Bulma, and Gohan went to Planet Namek to search for the Dragon Balls… But, that Saiyan called Vegeta also went there to search for the Dragon Balls…” Kaiō freaks out and realizes he means to take down Vegeta. “No, it seems it ain’t just Vegeta that Kuririn and everyone’s noticed. Before… That was my fault… When I stopped Kuririn from killing Vegeta… Furthermore, they can’t even return to Earth because their space ship is broken… But that ain’t just it. Something even more unbelievable… Some weird guys are also after the Dragon Balls. Strangely, they appeared to be just like Vegeta. But, there is someone with a ki that far exceeds Vegeta’s…”
 Yamcha and Kaiō freak out, and the others there (who can’t hear Goku) ask what’s wrong. Kaiō asks Goku if that person’s name is Freeza, but Goku doesn’t know. So, Kaiō decides to check himself, and Yamcha goes back with the others. Kaiō checks Planet Namek and sees Freeza flying through the air in his pod with the five Dragon Balls, and freaks out that it really was him. Kaiō tells Goku that Freeza is the worst there is, and that he should stay away from him. He also orders Goku to take his three friends and leave immediately as soon as he arrives on Planet Namek. An insufficient attack will just make Freeza angry, and unbelievable things will happen. Goku wants to see just how awesome this guy is, and Kaiō yells that he absolutely must stay away. Piccolo then comes over and puts his hand on Kaiō’s shoulder, and tells Goku to gather the Dragon Balls and return them to life. They’ll learn great techniques here, and then go to Planet Namek and fight that bastard too.
 Kaiō says that’s stupid, and they have no idea just how strong Freeza is. Piccolo says there’s no time, and asks to start the training now. Kaiō says he won’t train them unless they promise not to go to Namek. Piccolo says okay, but thinks to himself that he won’t keep a promise like that. Tenshinhan thinks to himself that he won’t surpass Goku from receiving the same training as him. But if he just quickly picks up the points of the training and refines them, he could be like before. Kaiō then tells them they’ll have to make him laugh with a pun; if they pass the test, he’ll train them. Everyone freaks out, and the narration says the test is especially hard for Tenshinhan and Piccolo. Up in his ship, Goku is not very intent on listening to Kaiō’s warning, and decides he’ll try 50G.
 “And on Planet Namek…” Dende is flying through the air on the way to the Eldest’s place, and Kuririn asks about how long it’ll take them to get there flying. Dende says five hours, and Kuririn doesn’t like the idea of using so much energy for that long. Vegeta, meanwhile, is still searching for a place with a bunch of powers gathered, but can’t find any, and wonders if there are no more villages. Then he suddenly feels two powers and stops. One of the powers doesn’t feel like either a Namekian or one of Freeza’s group. He wants to find out who it is, and zooms off. Kuririn then yells at Dende to halt, because he feels Vegeta coming towards them at an incredible speed. Kuririn then grabs Dende’s hand and takes the two of them down to an island to hide. But then Kuririn notices his direction has changed, towards the direction of another ki. Vegeta says it’s definitely Zarbon, as Zarbon flies around looking for a village. Vegeta suddenly appears in front of Zarbon, and says it’s been a while. “I’ve taken care of Dodoria… Now it’s your turn…”
"
Vegeta vs. Zarbon,262 (DBZ 68),"The cover of this chapter shows Goku standing in a fighting pose.
 Zarbon can’t believe he killed Dodoria, and Vegeta says he’ll make him believe. Zarbon asks Vegeta why he’s defying Freeza, and so he explains about not liking taking orders from him and how he wants eternal life for himself. If he had eternal life, his chances of winning against Freeza would increase. Zarbon tells him eternal life wouldn’t be enough to win against Freeza. Vegeta says it’s a shame Zarbon doesn’t have a scouter, because his power has gone up to unimaginable levels. Zarbon says he doesn’t know where Vegeta stands, but he knows Freeza has far transcended him. Vegeta says to cut the crap, the talking is over. He tells Zarbon that Dodoria said Freeza was scared of the Saiyan. So he’ll show him that Saiyan power he was afraid of.
 Zarbon's Elegant Blaster Zarbon says Freeza was scared of the ones who’d conspired together, not just one. This just makes Vegeta smirk, and he disappears, reappearing next to Zarbon. Zarbon punches at him, but Vegeta catches his fist, then throws him up further into the air. Zarbon catches himself, though, and fires a huge blast down towards Vegeta. Vegeta waits for it and swats the blast off to the side, causing a huge explosion off in the distance. Kuririn and Dende aren’t too far from the explosion, and Kuririn notes that two awesome ki (Vegeta and someone) are fighting. He knows that someone was with Freeza, though.
 Kuririn gets pissed that he can’t contend with them and hopes they really beat each other up. He grabs Dende and says to hold on tight, then flies off. He says this is their chance, while Vegeta’s busy fighting they’ll hurry up to the Eldest’s place. Meanwhile, Vegeta elbows Zarbon in the face, then Zarbon kicks at him, but Vegeta dodges it. Vegeta does a mid-air back flip and kicks Zarbon off into the distance, and flies after him. Zarbon lands on the ground, but Vegeta is right behind him, and kicks him across the ground. Zarbon stands back up, and tells Vegeta he’s improved. “But, it’s your fault… You’ve awoken my true power that’s been sleeping for a long time…”
"
Zarbon's True Power,263 (DBZ 69),"The cover of this chapter shows the dead Z Fighters, Tien Shinhan, Piccolo, Yamcha and Chiaotzu training on King Kai's Planet. Yamcha is chasing Bubbles.
 Vegeta thinks Zarbon’s threat is hilarious, and Zarbon decides to explain his true power before Vegeta dies. Zarbon says that it’s a difficult transformation to bring out his true power. He prefers this beautiful form, which is why he can’t stand transforming. “But, I’ll choose transforming over death…” Vegeta laughs at the idea of him transforming like the Saiyans do. Zarbon says he has no need to transform into something large like those Saiyan monkeys do--it’s just his power that grows. Vegeta wants to see this. And then bam, Zarbon suddenly bulks up into an ugly, toad-faced gator-monster and rushes at Vegeta, grabbing his head, and gives Vegeta a nasty headbutt. He tosses Vegeta into the air, but Vegeta catches himself and dives back down towards Zarbon.
 Zarbon flies up towards him, and they meet up, Zarbon’s fist to Vegeta’s face. Zarbon then kicks Vegeta off into the distance, and Vegeta just barely catches himself, running out of breath now. Zarbon tells Vegeta he can’t hide his surprise that he’s of a transforming race. Zarbon says things have now turned, and decides to tell him something good before he dies. “Freeza is also of a transforming race!” Vegeta freaks out and Zarbon says someone who can’t even beat him is certainly no match for Freeza, as he fires a huge ki blast at Vegeta. Vegeta just barely dodges it, but Zarbon grabs hold of him from behind. Zarbon then zooms straight down, and sends Vegeta crashing headfirst into the ground. Zarbon doubts Vegeta had survived that; and even if he did, he’d probably drown. He changes back to his normal form again and decides to report back to FrIeza about this. After Zarbon flies off, Vegeta slowly resurfaces and tries to pull himself back on land, vowing to get even stronger...

The Great Elder's House,264 (DBZ 70),"The cover shows Krillin and Dende flying towards Grand Elder Guru's house.
 The other henchman wonders why a village they haven’t been to yet is wiped out, and realizes it must be Vegeta’s doing. He thinks he should tell Freeza and flies off. Meanwhile, Freeza is back at their ship floating in the air staring outside a big window, when the intercom says, “Freeza-sama, it’s Zarbon”. Freeza tells him to enter, and the door slides open and he comes in. Freeza asks if he’s found a village, but Zarbon says no, though he has defeated Vegeta. Freeza asks if Vegeta’s dead, and Zarbon says he didn’t confirm the corpse, but the odds are slim considering the severity of his injuries.
 Freeza asks why he didn’t confirm it, and Zarbon explains that he was underwater. Freeza figures he’s neglected to confirm it because he doesn’t like getting wet. Zarbon says it was inexcusable and he’ll confirm it immediately. Then the other henchman arrives at the ship and says he’s found a village, but it’s already been destroyed. Zarbon figures it must’ve been Vegeta, but he didn’t have a Dragon Ball with him. Freeza tells Zarbon to bring Vegeta back here, and he’d better hope he’s still alive. He also orders the other henchman, Appule, to contact Planet Freeza and have the Ginyu Special-Squad come here in five days. Zarbon freaks out and asks why he wants the Ginyu Special-Squad, and Freeza says he has a strange premonition… A strange feeling about a strong Saiyan. He’s not sure it’s Vegeta, though. Zarbon says if it’s not Vegeta, then it must be the person or the kid from that Earth planet, though they’re considerably weaker than Vegeta.
 Freeza asks if he doubts his premonition, and tells him to hurry and bring Vegeta here. Zarbon flies off, and Freeza thinks to himself some more. The Saiyan have endless fighting potential, though they’re of course no match for him. But in the future, if they continue to sprout up, they could be really troublesome if one became a Super Saiyan. Meanwhile, Vegeta struggles across the ground, but Zarbon has returned and spots him. Zarbon says he’s pretty tough, and decides he’ll need some medical treatment before he can tell them anything. So he grabs Vegeta by the wrist and flies off with him. “Due to the fact that Planet Namek has three suns, the sun never sets… And so, about one day’s time has passed… Goku still continues to train all day and all night…” Goku jumps around the room training, and finally lays down on the floor, exhausted.
 Kuririn and Dende are resting on an island, when Kuririn wakes up and yells at Dende to wake up and lead them to the Eldest’s place. He picks up Dende and starts flying, having Dende direct him. “A little to the left, and then atop the tall rock.” There’s a house atop the tall rock, and Dende says they’ll find the Eldest inside. The door opens as they go toward it, and a young Namekian man comes out, whom Dende calls Nail. Nail says the Eldest knows the situation already, and Dende asks him why they haven’t left. Nail explains that the time of the Eldest’s death is near, and it’s Nail’s duty to protect him. They all step into the house, and we see that the Eldest is a very large, heavy old Namekian, seated in a large chair. He thanks Kuririn for saving Dende, and Kuririn says it was nothing.

The Dragon Balls Change Hands,265 (DBZ 71),"The cover features Grand Elder Guru seated in his chair. The One-Star Dragon Ball lies in a hole on the top of the chair, directly above his head.
 The Grand Elder giving Krillin the One-Star Ball Having arrived at the Grand Elder's house, Krillin and Dende implore him to let them borrow the One-Star Dragon Ball. When Dende mentions Earth's Dragon Balls, the Grand Elder is surprised but quickly deduces that the Nameless Namekian must have been their creator. He then reads Krillin's mind and learns that the Nameless Namekian had split in two. Being satisfied with Krillin's motives, he gives Krillin the One-Star Ball and unlocks his hidden inner strength. Thrilled with his newfound strength, Krillin rushes off with the Dragon Ball to bring Gohan to the Elder as well.
 Back at their cave, Gohan and Bulma use the Dragon Radar and detect two signals: the approaching ball being carried by Krillin, and a stationary signal near the village that Vegeta had previously attacked. The pair incorrectly assume that Vegeta had been unable to find the ball and left (while he had really hidden the ball to prevent Frieza from obtaining it). Gohan thus races off with the radar to find the ball himself.
 Zarbon and Appule checking in on Vegeta Meanwhile, on Frieza's Spaceship, Vegeta heals in a Medical Machine while Zarbon and Appule discuss how to get him to disclose the Dragon Ball's location. After Zarbon leaves to report to Frieza, Vegeta awakes and blasts his way out of the tank, killing Appule in the process. He then blasts a hole in the ship's wall as a distraction. When Zarbon and Frieza, having heard the noise, run back to the room, Vegeta is nowhere to be found. Concluding that he has fled, Frieza sends Zarbon outside the ship to find him. With his captors distracted, Vegeta excitedly races to the room where Frieza's five Dragon Balls lie unguarded.
"
"Vegeta's Laughter, Freeza's Rage",266 (DBZ 72),"The cover features Vegeta laughing while Frieza has a look of disdain and anger on his face.
 The chapter begins with Gohan using the Dragon Radar to search for the Dragon Ball that Vegeta left behind. The radar leads Gohan to the Namekian village that Vegeta destroyed. Gohan is horrified by what he sees, but quickly finds the Dragon Ball hidden underwater.
 Vegeta throwing the dragon balls off Frieza's ship Meanwhile, Zarbon searches near Frieza's Spaceship for Vegeta, who they believe has fled after escaping his Medical Machine. Frieza, impatient, threatens to kill Zarbon if he is unable to locate Vegeta. However, Vegeta is actually inside the ship and has located Frieza's now-unguarded Dragon Balls. Realizing that he cannot carry all five that are there, he alerts Zarbon and Frieza to his location, then unleashes a blast in the hallway to obscure their view. Vegeta then blasts a hole in a window and tosses all five balls outside before escaping just in time. Zarbon and Frieza are irate, and Zarbon again begins searching outside the ship.
 As Vegeta flees unnoticed in a nearby body of water, a furious Frieza promises to kill Zarbon if he does not capture Vegeta within an hour. After surfacing and finding the balls he tossed, Vegeta briefly exults in his achievement before noticing Krillin carrying the One-Star Ball. The chapter concludes with Vegeta being pleased with his good fortune.

Reunion of Terror!,267 (DBZ 73),"The cover shows Krillin and Bulma frightened in the foreground, while Vegeta stands with a determined posture and Zarbon stares with a sinister glare in the background. Krillin holds the Namekian One-Star Dragon Ball.
 Vegeta dodges Zarbon's attack After spotting Krillin flying with the One-Star Ball, Vegeta begins to chase him. Not realizing that Gohan has stolen the ball he hid underwater, Vegeta believes that taking the ball Krillin has will give him all seven. Despite having no scouter, Zarbon luckily spots Krillin and Vegeta. Recognizing Krillin from their earlier confrontation, he begins to pursue the pair. Vegeta senses Zarbon behind him and vows to defeat him.
 Krillin reaches the cave where Bulma was hiding and finds her outside reading. Bulma is surprised by Krillin's sudden appearance. Krillin expresses his desire to bring Gohan to the Great Elder, but Bulma informs him that Gohan left to get a Dragon Ball. Krillin senses the ki of Vegeta, who arrives on the scene and claims that he wants the Dragon Ball. Zarbon shows up soon after. After exchanging some words with Vegeta, Zarbon transforms into his monster form. He attacks Vegeta, who dodges his first few attacks before flying into the air and tossing sand into Zarbon's eyes. While Zarbon is temporarily blinded, Vegeta delivers a powerful punch to his back.

Vegeta in Overdrive!,268 (DBZ 74),"The cover features Vegeta with the seven Namekian Dragon Balls in the background.
 Vegeta punches Zarbon in the back Having just sent Zarbon flying with a powerful punch in the back, Vegeta chases after him and slams him into the water from above. Vegeta follows up with a series of ki blasts. Krillin suggests to Bulma that they flee while Vegeta is distracted, but Bulma is afraid that Vegeta will attack them if they do. Krillin grabs her and begins to flee regardless, but Vegeta does indeed notice them and blocks their path with several blasts. While Vegeta is distracted, Zarbon emerges from the water and flies towards him, leading to the two of them returning to the ground. Zarbon angrily claims that Vegeta will pay for what he has done, but Vegeta is undaunted. He briefly taunts Zarbon before explaining that he is now more powerful, due to having received Saiyan Power after their previous battle. Krillin notes that Goku has indeed displayed this characteristic in the past.
 Vegeta about to finish Zarbon Zarbon, however, is still adamant that he will defeat Vegeta, and the two begin to fight again. After a furious but quick volley of blows, Vegeta lands a punch clean into Zarbon's chest, breaking his armor and drawing blood. Zarbon, clearly unable to fight further, says that he was only following orders and asks for mercy, even offering to work with Vegeta. Vegeta is unmoved and kills Zarbon with a Ki Blast through the chest, much to Krillin's horror. After noting that he could not defeat Frieza even with Zarbon's aid, Vegeta mentions that Krillin seems to have improved as well but is still not on his level. Krillin agrees to give Vegeta the One-Star Dragon Ball in exchange for being left alone. Vegeta stays true to his word and flies off with the ball, while Krillin hopes that Gohan can keep Vegeta from obtaining his wish.
"
Brains and Brawn,269 (DBZ 75),"The cover features Vegeta intimidatingly looking over Gohan while holding the One-Star Namekian Dragon Ball.
 The chapter opens with Krillin and Bulma standing near their cave after Vegeta leaves with their Dragon Ball. Bulma complains that it is all over now that Vegeta has it, but Krillin tells her that it should be okay anyways, as the ball that Gohan is after was really hidden by Vegeta, so Vegeta will not have all seven. Gohan is then seen flying back to the cave with the Four-Star Ball when he senses a powerful ki, which he identifies as Vegeta. Vegeta senses Gohan as well, though Gohan quickly suppresses his ki and hides behind a rock.
 Vegeta, knowing that someone is nearby, threatens aloud to destroy the entire area. Gohan puts down the Dragon Ball and emerges to confront Vegeta. Vegeta tells Gohan that he took his Dragon Ball from Krillin, and asks Gohan what the Dragon Radar is. Gohan tells him that it is simply a watch, and Vegeta mocks Earthlings for not having the technology to create a smaller one. After asking whether Goku is on Namek, Vegeta knees Gohan in the chest and flies off. Though hurt, Gohan still manages to bring the Dragon Ball back to Krillin and Bulma, who decide that they must quickly leave their cave.
 Meanwhile, Vegeta has gone to look underwater for the ball that he hid (which Gohan took). When he is unable to find it, he quickly realizes that it was Gohan's doing and that the Dragon Radar is not simply a watch. Enraged, he flies back to the cave, but finds it deserted. Gohan, Krillin, and Bulma have hidden inside a chasm on another island. Bulma complains about their living conditions, and Krillin states his intent to take Gohan to Grand Elder Guru's house.
"
Premonitions of War,270 (DBZ 76),"The shows Goku bruised and bloodied, and with his traditional martial arts uniform torn and shredded.
 Bulma, eating in their hideout, complains about how Gohan and Krillin have left her alone. The two fly towards Grand Elder Guru's house, though at a low speed so Vegeta will not sense their energy. Krillin states his confidence that they can handle Vegeta together once Gohan's power has been unlocked. Vegeta returns to where he hid his Dragon Balls, and decides that hiding them is useless if Gohan and Krillin can detect them. He resolves to take the two of them out.
 Meanwhile, aboard his spaceship, Goku is now training at 100 times normal gravity. He trains using Ki Blasts before collapsing in exhaustion. He manages to eat a Senzu Bean and gets right back to work. By the next day, 100G is barely challenging him anymore, and he decides that his training is complete. Turning the gravity back down to normal to readjust, he finds his speed drastically improved, and thinks that he could handle a Kaio-ken x10. He then bathes and goes to sleep and his ship speeds onward.
 On his spaceship, Frieza concludes that Zarbon has either been killed or run away, and laments not calling the Ginyu Force earlier. He also concludes that Vegeta has not yet gathered all seven Dragon Balls. Krillin and Gohan have stopped to have a snack, and Krillin is confident that they can pick up their speed as they are now far away from Vegeta. However, Krillin's confidence is misplaced, as Vegeta quickly detects the pair.
"
The Enemy of My Enemy...,271 (DBZ 77),"The cover of this chapter features Gohan, Krillin, Vegeta and Nail sensing the arrival of the Ginyu Force.
 Having sensed the ki of both Krillin and Gohan, Vegeta is surprised that they are not coming after his Dragon Balls. He decides to fly after them and take their Dragon Ball, bringing one of his with him in case Bulma finds his location with the Dragon Radar. Krillin and Gohan finally have Guru's house in their sights, but sense Vegeta coming after them. Krillin decides to stall Vegeta and buy some time while Gohan goes on ahead. Vegeta soon arrives and demands the Dragon Ball, but Krillin pretends not to know what he is talking about. However, Vegeta senses the Namekians at Guru's house and guesses that the Dragon Ball is there. Krillin denies it, but Vegeta flies by him towards the house.
 Meanwhile, Guru has sensed Gohan's great hidden power, and realizes that he is not human. Gohan begs him to hurry. Vegeta arrives, but Nail refuses to allow him to enter. Gohan's power is successfully unlocked, and the resulting change in ki is so great that Vegeta believes Goku is inside. He is stunned when Gohan emerges from the house. Guru tells Dende to warn everyone that a large power is coming to Namek. Dende does so, and everyone soon senses a huge ki. Vegeta determines that there are really five kis, which means that the Ginyu Force has almost arrived.
 Vegeta demands the Dragon Ball, saying that he will leave them all in peace if they give it to him. He states his desire to make himself immortal to combat the Ginyu Force. Krillin wants to make Gohan immortal instead, but Vegeta does not think that he has the necessary battle experience to defeat them. Nail informs the group that the Namekian Dragon Balls actually grant three wishes, rather than just one as on Earth. Knowing this, Krillin agrees to take Vegeta to the last Dragon Ball, and they, along with Gohan, fly off. Guru tells Nail to help them out, and that he will live a bit longer. In space, the space pods of the Ginyu Force have almost reached the planet.

 The Ginyu Force's first appearance The chapter begins with Frieza excitedly awaiting the Ginyu Force's imminent arrival. In a race against time, Vegeta, Krillin, and Gohan fly back to the chasm where Bulma is waiting, take the Dragon Ball there, and fly off. Bulma is confused as to why Kuririn and Gohan are now working with Vegeta.
 At Frieza's Spaceship, the Ginyu Force finally land and present themselves to Freeza with a set of absurd poses. Freeza is visibly discomfited by this display, but decides to quickly get down to business. He orders the Ginyu Force to get the Dragon Ball and capture Vegeta alive, while killing the others. Captain Ginyu tells Frieza that their scouters have already found Vegeta, and Jeice gives Frieza a box of new scouters that he had requested. With their orders set, the Ginyu Force fly off to pursue Vegeta, who immediately notes their speed.
 In space, Goku is awakened by the onboard computer, which announces that twenty minutes remain until arrival on Namek. He gets dressed, and mentally prepares himself for the upcoming battle. He does not feel afraid at all, much to his own confusion. Meanwhile, Vegeta, Gohan, and Kuririn almost make it back to the rest of the Dragon Balls in time, but the Ginyu Force arrives a split second before them, much to their dismay.
"
Five Deadly Fighters,273 (DBZ 79),"The cover of this chapter shows all members of the Ginyu Force standing behind each other and ordered by height, from the shortest to the tallest.
 Having arrived at the location of the five Dragon Balls a split second before Vegeta, Krillin, and Gohan, the Ginyu Force appear to be in control. Captain Ginyu notes that the five balls there plus the two Vegeta and Krillin are carrying makes all seven. Vegeta vows not to hand his ball over, while Kuririn senses the group's power levels. He notices that Ginyu is by far the strongest, while Guldo is much weaker than the rest.
 Krillin and Gohan power up After Ginyu confirms to Vegeta that the scouters cannot track Dragon Balls, Vegeta hurls his away, only for the speedy Burter to quickly grab it in midair and return. Ginyu claims that Burter is the ""fastest in the universe."" Desperate, Vegeta tells Kuririn to destroy his Dragon Ball, but when he brings his hand down to strike it, the ball disappears. The group notices that Guldo has the ball, and Vegeta says that he had heard rumors that Guldo can stop time. Ginyu tells the rest of the Force to take out Vegeta, Kuririn, and Gohan while he brings the Dragon Balls to Frieza. The four remaining Ginyus play a game of rock-paper-scissor to determine who fights who, and Recoome wins, getting Vegeta. Guldo ends up getting Gohan and Kuririn.
 Vegeta asks Kuririn and Gohan if Goku is really on Namek, noting that he could be helpful. Kuririn informs him that Goku is on his way and should arrive soon. Recoome tells Guldo to fight first. Gohan and Kuririn power up, drastically raising their Power Levels, to the visible surprise of Jeice, Recoome, and Burter. They fly into the air and each fire a Ki Blast at Guldo.

Gurd's Psychic Powers,274 (DBZ 80),"The cover features all members of the Ginyu Force doing a flamboyant fighting pose.
 As Gohan and Krillin's Ki Blasts head towards him, Guldo uses Time Freeze to allow himself to escape. He briefly allows time to restart while he turns before quickly stopping it again. When he does, he is surprised at how far Gohan and Kuririn have moved. Unable to hold time any longer, he lets it restart. The blasts hit the ground, and Kuririn and Gohan quickly determine where Gurd is before disappearing from sight. Gurd stops time with the pair quickly closing in and hides behind some rocks, but they immediately detect him again as soon as time restarts.
 Watch your head! Unable to stop time any more, Gurd is forced to resort to using telekinesis to render his attackers immobile. Jeice notes that Gohan and Kuririn had power levels over 10,000, which Recoome says must have scared Gurd. Burter notes that being able to change power level without transforming is rare, and Vegeta rues the fact that Gohan and Kuririn having seemingly ignored his advice about Gurd. With the pair paralyzed, Gurd uses his telekinesis to throw a sharp tree trunk at them. However, Vegeta quickly steps in and decapitates Gurd with one clean blow. Released from the telekinesis, Gohan and Kuririn are able to dodge at the last second.
 Gurd's decapitated head argues that Vegeta's attack was not fair, but Vegeta says that he never agreed to the rules, and that nothing's fair in battle. Gurd calls Vegeta a ""monkey-butt,"" and Vegeta disintegrates his head with a ki blast. Gohan and Kuririn thank Vegeta for saving them, but he says that it was just a good chance to kill Gurd. Butta, Jheese, and Reacoom are upset that their fighting pose is now messed up, and begin to play Rock-Paper-Scissors to see who will fight next. Vegeta says that now the real test will begin.

 With Guldo having been killed by Vegeta, Recoome steps up to fight him next. He tells Vegeta that he can even have Krillin and Gohan help him if he wants, but Jeice objects that they are for him and Burter. Reacoom performs a special pose, presumably to help him get prepared for battle.
 Vegeta fires the Final Crash at Reacoom Vegeta then powers up, shocking everyone there. Jeice exclaims that his power level is over 20,000 and still rising. With Reacoom distracted by his power boost, Vegeta charges at him and connects with a punch to the face, knocking off Reacoom's scouter and sending him falling backwards. Before he can even hit the ground, Vegeta quickly moves behind him and smashes him down from above, then follows up by slamming his knees into Reacoom's chest. He grabs the stunned Reacoom's left leg and hurls him into a nearby rock formation before attacking with a Final Crash. Kuririn and Gohan dive out of the way, and the huge blast hits home. Kuririn believes that the fight is over.
 However, much to the shock of Vegeta, Kuririn, and Gohan, Reacoom is not only still alive, but seemingly unaffected aside from the loss of his armor. Reacoom says it is time to really get started, while Butta complains about all the dust Vegeta has kicked up. Reacoom darts towards Vegeta and unleashes a Recoome Kick, sending the Saiyan prince hurtling backwards.

 Having been sent flying by a Recoome Kick, Vegeta manages to regain his composure in midair and bounces himself off the ground and back upwards. He charges at Recoome, and the two spar briefly, with Recoome saying that Vegeta is better than he had thought. Recoome connects with a strong blow to the back of the neck, sending Vegeta crashing to the ground. He attempts to follow up with a punch, but Vegeta springs into the air. Recoome quickly gives chase.
 In the air, Vegeta fires a Ki Blast while attempting to evade Recoome. Recoome, however, is too fast. He easily catches up to Vegeta and kicks him down into the water below. He laughs as Krillin and Gohan stare. Vegeta unexpectedly darts out of the water and slams into Recoome's chest, but Recoome grabs him and hurtles towards the ground, throwing Vegeta into it at the last minute. He pulls the Saiyan out of the ground, asking jocularly if he is okay. Vegeta responds by firing an upside down blast into Recoome's face, knocking him backwards and giving Vegeta time to get back up.
 Despite the point-blank hit, Recoome is still seemingly unharmed and is even more excited, claiming the blast was what he wanted. Burter calls him a narcissist. Recoome asks if Vegeta has anything with more oomph, while Vegeta bristles at being treated as a plaything. Recoome prepares to attack, and Krillin tells Gohan to charge in, realizing that they have no hope if Vegeta is defeated. However, unbeknownst to Krillin, the Capsule Corporation spaceship carrying Goku has only two minutes left until it lands on Namek.

Before the blast can hit Vegeta, Gohan swoops in and pushes him out of its path, while Krillin kicks the unsuspecting Recoome in the head. When explosion from the blast clears, Vegeta angrily tells Gohan to get out of his way and that he did not ask for his help. He also says that Gohan should have attacked Recoome instead, and that his sentimentality makes him wretch.
 Recoome kicks Krillin Recoome quickly recovers as well, though he reveals that Krillin has knocked out several of his teeth, making him angry. He asks Burter and Jeice to let him take out Krillin and Gohan as well. The pair reluctantly agree in exchange for chocolate parfaits later on. Recoome sends Krillin flying with a kick, and once he lands the dejected warrior claims that it is all over. Meanwhile, Nail decides to return to help Guru rather than aid Krillin and Gohan as Guru had ordered.
 Gohan attacks Recoome with a Ki Blast, but Recoome easily blows it back at him. Gohan dodges, but Recoome appears next to him and hits him.

 Ecstatic at finally having all seven Dragon Balls together, Frieza commands the balls to give him eternal life. He is disconcerted when nothing seems to happen. Captain Ginyu asks if he is now immortal, and Frieza replies that he does not believe so. Wondering why nothing happened, he recalls a Namekian elder telling him that he would not be able to get his wish, even if he did manage to get all seven.

Frieza sets off to find them, leaving Ginyu to guard the Dragon Balls.

Gohan is send flying and slams into the ground as Krillin and Vegeta watch.
 As Gohan lies motionless, Jeice says that he has no energy left, which Burter says is a result of his neck being broken.

 After Goku's spaceship lands on Namek, the battle between Recoome and Gohan comes to a halt. Recoome wonders aloud what kind of ship it was, and Krillin declares that Goku has come at last. As the spaceship door opens, Goku quickly detects the ki of Krillin, Gohan, and the Ginyu Force, and realizes that Gohan and Krillin are badly injured. He flies off to find their location.
 Goku arrives quickly on the scene, to the shock of the Ginyu Force members. Goku gives Gohan a Senzu Bean while being taunted by Recoome, and his rapid recovery stuns Burter, Jeice, and Recoome. Gohan attempts to warn Goku how strong they are, but Goku ignores him and gives Krillin a Senzu Bean as well. Krillin attempts to explain the situation, but Goku simply reads his mind to discover everything that has happened. Krillin asks where Goku got this power, and Goku says he just felt it would work. He decides to give the last Senzu Bean to a puzzled Vegeta, before saying that he wants to fight the Ginyu Force alone.
 Despite the objections of Krillin and Gohan, Goku walks out to face Recoome. Recoome asks what Goku's Power Level is, and Burter tells him that it is merely 5,000. Recoome says Goku is just another letdown. Vegeta, however, is confused by Goku's calm in the face of such danger, before having some sort of realization about what Goku might have become.
"
Super Saiyan?,280 (DBZ 86),"The cover of this chapter features a young, childlike version of Goku looking up confusingly at an adult and grown up version of himself. In the English Translation, Adult Goku is saying ""I've grown up quite a bit, haven't I?""
 The chapter opens with Recoome voicing his surprise over Goku's confidence. Goku tells Recoome that he will not win, which Recoome laughs off as a bluff. Krillin and Gohan are puzzled by Goku's behavior, while Vegeta angrily tells himself that Goku could never become the legendary Super Saiyan. He recalls the story that a Super Saiyan appears only once every thousand years; he believes that it is a myth and that the only Saiyan capable is himself.

Recoome then prepares to unleash his ultimate attack, which he claims will destroy a large circle around him. However, as Recoome prepares to attack, Goku elbows him in the chest, sending him to the ground with one blow. Everyone else is shocked. Jeice and Burter believe the attack was somehow a trick, while Vegeta realizes that it was just a tremendous attack.

Jheese and Butta,281 (DBZ 87),"ジースとバータ The cover of this chapter features Goku in the foreground, with Burter and Jeice laughing maniacally in the background.
 Goku punches Jeice in the face Having defeated Recoome, Goku asks if Jeice and Burter will leave now. The pair believe that Recoome's loss was a fluke as Goku's Power Level did not change, and decide to fight. Vegeta believes that they have no chance. Burter and Jeice fly over to Goku and land on opposite sides of him. Jeice begins to tell Goku not to underestimate the Ginyu Force, but Goku punches him in the face before he has finished. Goku then tells an angered Jeice that they (Jeice and Recoome) keep leaving themselves open.
 Jeice and Burter then attack with a kick and an elbow respectively, but Goku blocks both. He knees Jeice and sweeps Burter's legs, and the pair quickly move back. Goku then blasts them farther back with a powerful Kiai. Krillin and Gohan wonder how he can handle such powerful opponents with ease. Jeice is confused because his scouter still reads only 5,000 for Goku. Vegeta realizes that Goku raises his power level only at the moment of attack, and angrily wonders how he got enough power for such control.
 Annoyed, Jeice and Burter decide to have Jeice use his Crusher Ball technique, then have Burter hit Goku when he dodges. However, their plan is thwarted when Goku deflects the blast instead of dodging, much to their surprise. Burter manages to dodge the deflected blast, but Goku appears behind him, much to the horror of Jeice.

 Burter defeated The chapter opens with Jeice yelling to Burter that Goku is behind him. Burter, still believing he is the universe's fastest being, can not believe that Goku got behind him unnoticed. Goku says that Burter must be number two in speed. Burter asks who Goku is, and Goku informs him that he is a Saiyan raised on Earth. Burter asks how he is so fast, as Saiyans are not. Goku figures that it must be due to his difficult training. Burter says that Goku can not keep it up forever, and proceeds to unleash a flurry of punches and kicks. However, Goku easily dodges them all.
 Vegeta brutally executes Burter Enraged at Burter's lack of success, Jeice jumps into the fray, but both he and Burter together cannot hit Goku. Deciding to show them something more than speed, Goku sends Burter flying with a kick. He then follows up by smashing Burter towards the ground, then quickly gets underneath him so that Burter lands on his raised arm. Gohan, Krillin, and Jeice are stunned, while Vegeta yells for Goku to finish Burter. Goku tells Jeice that his friends are still alive, and that they can leave with their lives still intact if they stop. Jeice, frightened by Burter's demise, flees the scene. Gohan, Krillin, and Goku are all shocked by this.
 Vegeta finishes Recoome Vegeta, however, takes the opportunity of the sudden lull to finish off Burter with a fierce knee to the neck, and then annihilate Recoome with a Ki Blast. Goku is upset, telling Vegeta that Burter was powerless. Vegeta is disgusted, and tells Goku that he will never become a Super Saiyan with that attitude. Goku is confused by this, but Vegeta continues by saying that Frieza will never be defeated with such a naive viewpoint. The chapter ends with Frieza speeding in his hoverchair towards Guru's house.

Krillin agrees with Goku, but Vegeta tells them to fight Frieza if they do not believe him. He also says that Frieza probably has been granted eternal life by the Dragon Balls by now. Krillin disagrees, noting that the sky has not gone dark, as it does when Shenron appears on Earth. When Vegeta seems surprised that an actual dragon is involved, Goku realizes that neither Vegeta or Frieza will know how to activate the balls. He, Krillin, and Gohan begin to celebrate.
 Back at Frieza's Spaceship, Captain Ginyu is stunned as Jeice delivers the news that Recoome and Burter have been defeated. Deciding not to tell Frieza (as it would humiliate the Ginyu Force), Ginyu has Jeice bury the Dragon Balls near the ship. After lamenting the fact that their fighting pose no longer looks good with only two people, the pair fly off. Back at the battleground, the heroes discuss what to do next. Goku suggests that they find the Dragon Balls and use them to wish their friends back to life, but Vegeta still wants eternal life for himself.
 The conference is quickly brought to an end when Vegeta senses Jeice and Ginyu coming towards them. Goku also senses Frieza's ki farther off, heading in the direction of Guru's house. Gohan nervously realizes that Frieza will kill Guru once he learns how to use the balls, not realizing that his death will render them useless. Ginyu and Jeice arrive, and Ginyu quickly realizes that Goku has been raising his power in short bursts. He estimates Goku's true power level to be around 60,000. Goku sends Krillin and Gohan to fetch the Dragon Balls while he fights Ginyu. As Goku and Ginyu are about to begin, Vegeta flies away. This momentarily distracts Goku, and Ginyu takes the opportunity to begin to attack.

Ginyu says that Goku is good, but not good enough to beat him alone. Goku is still upset about Vegeta leaving to try and get the Dragon Balls. Vegeta believes that Goku and Ginyu are equally matched, and hopes they will take each other out while he beats the Dragon Ball invocation out of Gohan and Krillin.
 Goku powers up against Ginyu As Goku and Ginyu prepare to start again, Ginyu reveals that he can also change his battle power at will. Jeice, admiring the Captain, mentally notes that Ginyu's power level can dwarf even Goku's supposed 60,000 (which was Ginyu's estimate). Ginyu attacks with a Milky Cannon, which Goku dodges. Goku attacks from above with a kick, which Ginyu dodges. The pair again spar before taking to the air, where Ginyu quickly realizes that Goku is faster than him. Despite this, Goku is distracted by a blast from another direction, allowing Ginyu to capture him in a Full Nelson. The shooter of this blast is revealed to be Jeice.
 However, a clearly upset Ginyu releases Goku just before he plans on using his Kaio-ken technique. Ginyu angrily tells Jeice not to interfere in the battle again or he will kill him. He then tells Goku to use his full strength, as he can tell that Goku has been concealing it. Goku tells Ginyu to watch the reading on his scouter. Ginyu now predicts that Goku's maximum power level is 85,000. Much to his surprise, however, when Goku powers up using the Kaio-ken, his power level soars in excess of 110,000 and is still rising.

 Frieza meets Nail Goku continues to power up using the Kaio-ken technique, stunning Captain Ginyu and Jeice as his power level soars to 180,000. Jeice wonders how a Saiyan could become so strong, only for Goku to reveal that his power is much higher when used in bursts. Ginyu comes to the same conclusion that Vegeta had earlier, that Goku is the legendary Super Saiyan. This statement leaves Goku puzzled as to what a Super Saiyan is. The very suggestion of this frightens Jeice, as he says it is the only thing that Frieza ever feared.
 Just as Ginyu and Jeice seem to have completely despaired of their situation, Goku offers to let them live if they will leave the planet. Upon hearing this, Ginyu decides that Goku cannot be the legendary Super Saiyan, as the legend says that he will be bloodthirsty and love battle above all. Ginyu admits that he is outmatched but that this is what he has been waiting for.
 Meanwhile, Frieza races towards Guru's house. Nail senses Frieza coming, so Guru unlocks Dende's latent powers and sends him to help the Earthlings. Frieza passes Dende on his way but sees no need to stop and kill him. He soon arrives at Guru's house, and is confronted outside by Nail. Frieza tells Nail that he has all seven Dragon Balls and asks how to get his wish. Nail refuses to divulge the secret, so Frieza says he will kill Nail in order to obtain it. Nail warns him, however, of the fact that the Dragon Balls will disappear if Guru dies. Eager to see Guru himself, Frieza uses Eye Lasers to blast a hole in the wall of Guru's house. Guru tells Frieza that Nail is the lone true warrior of Namek, before telling Nail telepathically to buy as much time as possible. Frieza says that Nail will now be privileged to face the ultimate power.

"Nail, Champion of Namek",286 (DBZ 92),"The cover features Captain Ginyu in Goku's body, standing and wearing his green scouter.
 The chapter opens with Frieza being surprised that anyone would dare to face him. He tells Nail that he will regret not telling him the secret of the Dragon Balls. Nail notes that Guru is near death, and that they should fight somewhere else since Frieza needs him alive. Frieza agrees, though he does not think the battle will last that long. Nail flies away from Guru's house for a while before Frieza finally tells him that it is far enough. As they land, Frieza wonders how an entire planet can be suicidal.
 After they land, Nail powers up. Frieza is surprised as his power level reaches 42,000. Frieza says he almost wants him as one of his men, and then tells Nail that his power level is 530,000. Frieza also says that he will not fight at full strength and will use only one arm, which enrages Nail. He rushes at Frieza and strikes him in the neck, but Frieza is completely unfazed. With Nail's hand still against his neck, he grabs his arm and rips off the forearm. After briefly writhing in pain, Nail regenerates his forearm. Frieza is surprised but notes that Nail's power level has decreased, which leads him to wonder why Nail continues to fight.
 Meanwhile, Goku is curious why Captain Ginyu is laughing, even though he has admitted that Goku is stronger. Jeice realizes Ginyu's plan and is suddenly confident again. Ginyu gives Jeice his scouter before proceeding to strike himself in the chest. With Goku shocked, Ginyu successfully performs the Body Change maneuver.

 Goku is still confused as to why he is seeing himself, so Captain Ginyu tells him that he has switched their bodies. Jeice gives Ginyu his scouter, and the pair fly off. Goku realizes that this is why Ginyu hurt himself, and is afraid of what will happen when they run into Krillin and Gohan. Goku flies after them, but cannot fly very quickly due to his injuries. He wonders what Chi-Chi will say if he manages to make it home as Ginyu.
 Meanwhile, Krillin and Gohan return to Bulma's hideout to get the Dragon Radar. Bulma is confused and angry that they left her alone and have not gotten anything accomplished. They grab the radar and prepare to fly off, much to her chagrin. However, her mood brightens when Gohan tells her that Goku has arrived. After they leave, she wonders if she 'blew it' with Goku. Back at Frieza's Spaceship, Vegeta figures out that Frieza is gone and the Dragon Balls are hidden. Figuring that everyone else will be back soon, he changes into a new set of Battle Armor.
 When Krillin and Gohan arrive at Frieza's ship (looking for the Dragon Balls), Vegeta secretly watches as they dig all seven up. However, when Krillin calls forth the dragon, nothing happens, much to everyone's confusion. Krillin senses two large kis and figures they belong to Ginyu and Jeice, which annoys Vegeta. However, all three of them are surprised when Goku and Jeice arrive.

 Captain Ginyu (in Goku's body) and Jeice land at Frieza's spaceship. They are surprised to see the Dragon Balls in the open, and wonder how someone knew where they were buried. Krillin emerges from behind a rock and, thinking Ginyu is Goku, asks if Jeice joined their side after Ginyu was defeated. After Ginyu asks Krillin if it was him who dug up the balls and if they got their wish, Krillin asks why Ginyu is wearing a scouter. Ginyu asks if Krillin really wants to know, and Gohan yells to Krillin that it is not really Goku.
 Ginyu punches Krillin in the face, which leaves him confused. Gohan again tells him that it is not Goku. Ginyu confirms this, and reveals his identity, while leaving Gohan and Krillin stunned. Ginyu plans to test his new strength, while Krillin refuses to believe that it is not really Goku. Meanwhile, the injured Goku flies along, upset that his new body feels strange. He then realizes that Ginyu will have the same problem with his body.
 Ginyu furiously attacks both Krillin and Gohan at once, but Jeice quickly notices Goku arriving at the scene. Upon landing, Goku confirms that he and Ginyu switched bodies. Ginyu is surprised that Goku even made it there with his injuries. Goku claims that Ginyu will not be able to use the Kaio-ken, and proceeds to power up. However, he and Jeice are unpleasantly surprised when his power level reads only 23,000. Krillin says that they can win this, and Ginyu tells Jeice to fight as well. However, Vegeta appears behind him and says that it is him who he will have to fight.

Ginyu is confused as to why he cannot generate much power, and Krillin tells him that he does not know how to use Goku's body (as Goku had told him previously). Krillin tells him to give up. Ginyu refuses, and the two spar.
 Vegeta kills Jeice Meanwhile, Vegeta and Jeice are sparring. Jeice is puzzled as to how Vegeta could hide from his scouter, and Vegeta says that Jeice relies on it too much. He tells Jeice to read his power level now, and Jeice is stunned at the reading. Vegeta tells Jeice that he is getting close to becoming a Super Saiyan, which Jeice nervously scoffs at. Vegeta kicks Jeice and then strikes him in the chest, breaking his armor. He then obliterates Jeice with a Genocide Breaker, shocking all of the other combatants. Goku says that he has gone too far.
 Vegeta then turns his attention to Ginyu, hitting him several times in succession before slamming him into the ground. Goku pleads with Vegeta not to kill Ginyu, but Vegeta charges down towards Ginyu, preparing to kill him. However, Ginyu laughs as he descends, and begins to execute the Body Change technique.

Goku manages to get in front of Ginyu as the change occurs, leaving the two of them back in their original bodies. Gohan quickly realizes what has occurred. However, as Gohan, Vegeta, and Krillin discuss the current situation, Ginyu decides to try again at acquiring Vegeta's body. Goku once again realizes his plan, and throws a frog in front of the Body Change beam.
 When the technique is over, everyone else is confused as to what has happened. Goku explains that Ginyu and the frog have changed places, ending the immediate threat. Vegeta wants to kill Ginyu in his new frog body, but Goku tells him not to. Vegeta relents, saying that living as a frog will be torture enough. He then says that he could kill the rest of them now, but that he will need their help for the battle against Frieza.
 Realizing that Goku will have to be at full strength to fight Frieza, Vegeta leads him into Frieza's Spaceship. Goku is put inside a Medical Machine to recover. Vegeta then decides to give Gohan and Krillin Battle Armor like his, which Gohan says will feel weird.

Nail's Sacrifice,291 (DBZ 97),"The cover shows an enraged Frieza in his first form.
 Onboard Frieza's Spaceship, Vegeta gives Gohan and Krillin their own sets of Battle Armor. Krillin says that Frieza must be very powerful if Vegeta needs their help, and Gohan admits that he is scared. They have trouble getting their armor on, and Vegeta reveals that it stretches, noting that it stayed intact when he went Great Ape on Earth. Krillin is excited about how light the armor feels. He asks Vegeta when Goku will be healed. Vegeta replies that it should take 40 to 50 minutes, so Krillin decides to head off alone to Guru's house to find out the password for the Dragon Balls.
 Meanwhile, Frieza and Nail continue their fight. Despite only using one arm, Frieza has wounded Nail considerably. He demands to know the password, but Nail responds with a Mystic Flasher. However, Frieza is unaffected and tells Nail that he is going to lose. He vanishes and appears directly in front of Nail, knocking him down with a hit to the face. Nail smiles and says that it does not matter anymore, since Dende should have reached Gohan and Krillin by now.
 Frieza suddenly realizes that Nail has been buying time, and that Dende (whom he passed and ignored earlier) was going to give Gohan and Krillin the password. Enraged, he flies away at top speed towards his ship, screaming that only he deserves the power of immortality. He also notices that the scouter readings for the Ginyu Force have vanished. In his house, Guru laments that he did not tell the Earthlings the password earlier. While flying towards Frieza's ship, Dende runs into Krillin and the two are excited about their momentary good fortune.

Dende reveals that Guru has told him the secret to using the Dragon Balls: the incantation must be spoken in the Namekian language. At Frieza's Spaceship, Vegeta takes a nap while Gohan waits. Gohan senses the ki of Krillin and Dende, who soon arrive. When Gohan informs him that Vegeta is asleep, Krillin proposes that they take the Dragon Balls and make their wish before he wakes up. Gohan and Dende agree, and they successfully sneak off with the Dragon Balls.
 However, Gohan and Krillin sense Frieza coming towards them quickly. Dende hurriedly chants the incantation in Namekian. The sky darkens, and Porunga appears, whom Dende calls the ""God of Dreams."" From his planet in Other World, King Kai watches excitedly with the dead Dragon Team. Porunga says he will grant three wishes, which excites Krillin (as Shenron can only grant one at a time). Their first wish is to revive everyone killed by the Saiyans on Earth, but Porunga can only revive one person at a time. King Kai delivers the bad news to his companions, and Piccolo demands that he be allowed to speak with Gohan.
"
The Three Wishes,293 (DBZ 99),"The cover features the wish-granting dragon Porunga.
 With Frieza and potentially Vegeta approaching, Gohan, Krillin, and Dende try to decide who to bring back to life first. King Kai allows Piccolo to speak to Gohan and Krillin via telepathy. Piccolo tells Gohan to bring him back to life first, as doing so will revive Kami on Earth and restore Earth's Dragon Balls. Yamcha and Tien remark that the idea is clever. Piccolo then asks that the second wish be used to bring him to Namek so that he avenge what Frieza has done to his people. He then tells them to do what they want with the third wish.
 Dende tells Porunga their first wish, restoring Piccolo to life. However, at Frieza's Spaceship, Vegeta is awoken from his slumber when he senses Frieza's ki approaching. He quickly notices the dark sky and sees Porunga. Realizing what has occurred, he angrily flies off towards the dragon. Back on Earth, Kami comes back to life as well, much to the surprise of Mr. Popo. Dende tells Porunga the second wish, and Piccolo vanishes from King Kai's Planet. Before anything else can be done, Vegeta arrives on the scene. Irate, he claims that they have lost their only chance to beat Frieza, which was to make him immortal.
 Gohan, visibly nervous, tells Vegeta that there is still one wish remaining, which pleases him. Frieza is now close enough to see Porunga. When he picks up Porunga's life reading on his scouter, he realizes the dragon has been called. Vegeta demands that the third wish be used to make him immortal, as Frieza is bearing down on them. The chapter ends with Piccolo, now on Namek, seeing his race's home planet for the first time.

Meanwhile, Porunga awaits a third wish. Vegeta demands that Dende use the wish to make him immortal. Krillin, although admitting that he hates Vegeta, reluctantly tells Dende to do it.
 Before Dende can make the wish, however, Porunga disappears. The sky lightens and the Dragon Balls fall to the ground as stones. Dende realizes that Guru has died. Vegeta becomes enraged, but quickly stops his outburst when he sees Frieza watching from a nearby cliff. Frieza jumps down and claims that, between defeating the Ginyu Force and rendering the Dragon Balls useless, they have made more of a fool of him than anyone has before. He promises to torture them to death inch by inch, leading Vegeta to comment on Frieza's change in mannerism. Frieza begins to power up, and Gohan and Krillin are stunned by his ki. Piccolo senses the increase as well, but also detects the faint ki of Nail, who is still barely alive. Piccolo lands next to him and realizes that he must be a fellow Namekian.

The Assimilation,295 (DBZ 101),"The cover features Piccolo standing in his traditional outfit.
 Piccolo, having landed next to Nail, realizes that the warrior is on the brink of death. Nail says that Piccolo must be the Namekian that the Earthlings had mentioned. Though surprised that Nail knows the situation, Piccolo says that he is in a hurry and must leave Nail to die. Nail tells him that if he were to become one again with Kami, he could surpass Frieza's power. Piccolo says that he has no desire to unite with Kami, so Nail tells Piccolo to assimilate him instead.
 Piccolo initially denies Nail's request, saying that he wants to keep his own personality. However, Nail assures him that his personality will stay the same, and Piccolo reluctantly agrees to give it a try. Once the assimilation is complete, Piccolo feels a surge of new power within him, and is convinced that he can now defeat any opponent. He then flies off to find the battle. Meanwhile, Frieza has finished powering up. Krillin says the situation is useless, but Vegeta believes that the three of them can win, citing the potential shown by Gohan and his belief that he is becoming a Super Saiyan. Frieza scoffs at the latter idea and charges at Vegeta.
 Much to Frieza's surprise, Vegeta manages to block both of his blows. As they struggle, Frieza's scouter explodes due to Vegeta's high power level. Frieza realizes that Vegeta was not entirely bluffing, and Vegeta tells Frieza to transform. Frieza is surprised that Vegeta knows he can do this, and Vegeta tells that Zarbon revealed it to him.

The Transformation,296 (DBZ 102),"The cover features Frieza smiling evilly.
 Frieza in his Second Form Frieza has agreed to transform, much to the shock and confusion of Gohan and Krillin. Vegeta explains that some beings transform for camouflage or to conserve energy. Frieza says that he transforms to keep himself under control, but Vegeta says that he will not be that different. Frieza says that this is something he does not do often, noting that he was able to kill Vegeta's father without needing to. Vegeta retorts that he had surpassed his father as a child.
 Frieza then proceeds to blow off his Battle Armor. Vegeta mockingly asks if that is his transformation. Frieza then proceeds to transform for real. His ki increases (as noted by Krillin) and his body grows much larger and taller, with the horns on his head now pointing upwards. Vegeta is shocked, not having realized that Frieza would change so much. Frieza says that he will not be as gentle as before, and that in this state his power level is over 1,000,000.
 Frieza impaling Krillin Vegeta exclaims that Frieza is a liar, but Frieza powers up, blasting everyone away. Krillin is hit by some debris while the others escape unscathed. Frieza congratulates them for being quick on their feet as he expected, but states that was only a minor display of his power as even Saiyans are capable of that. Frieza calls Vegeta pathetic, and then ponders who to send to Hell first. He quickly decides and charges straight at Krillin, impaling him on his left horn. Dende, who was being held by Krillin, escapes unharmed. Gohan is furious, while Vegeta is stunned at Frieza's speed.

Krillin hopes that Goku has a plan, but Piccolo says that he does not, and that Frieza is much stronger than they expected. However, Frieza says that destroying the planet would be anticlimactic.
 On King Kai's Planet, Tien Shinhan cannot believe that Goku is getting beat while using Kaio-ken x10. King Kai also reveals that Frieza is only using 50% of his power. He says that this is why he told Goku not to fight Frieza, and that Goku has lost. Meanwhile, Goku realizes that he needs to use to Kaio-ken x20 to have a chance.

Gohan prepares to jump into the fight, but Piccolo tells him to wait, as Goku is doing something.
 Goku has raised both hands to the sky, which Krillin recognizes as part of the Spirit Bomb technique, which he then explains to Piccolo. Piccolo says that King Kai never mentioned it to him. Gohan wonders if the Spirit Bomb will work on a planet with as little life as Namek. Goku calls for help from life on nearby planets to make the bomb larger.

Krillin is surprised at the size of the bomb, with Gohan commenting that the Spirit Bomb used against Vegeta was much smaller spreading his hands to show Piccolo to difference in size, while Krillin estimates this new Spirit Bomb that Goku is creating is about 150 feet across.

Krillin notes that Goku must be gathering energy from other planets, but says that Goku must be thinking he needs more ki for the Spirit Bomb to defeat Frieza. Frieza asks Goku what he is up to, while Goku silently hopes for just a few more seconds.
 Frieza, growing bored, kicks Goku. Goku is sent flying backwards, and Krillin is afraid that Frieza has figured out what Goku is up to. Piccolo says that he still has not, and asks Gohan and Krillin to transfer their remaining ki to him. Goku gets back on his feet and immediately begins to charge the bomb again, but Frieza knocks him backwards once more, this time into some nearby water.

 Goku shakes and expresses sympathy after finishing Frieza On Earth, Guru explains to his fellow Namekians how they came back to life. One of the Namekians notes that there is a village missing, and Vegeta says that it must be the one he attacked. He notes that the wish was to revive those killed by Frieza and his men, and that he no longer works for Frieza. This angers the Namekians, but just then the Namekian Dragon Balls fall to the ground, having also been transported to Earth. Guru tells Moori that he will be the next elder, and that he must find a place for the Namekians to live in peace. Guru then dies, and his body disappears. Piccolo tells Guru to rest in peace, and Dende realizes that he has fused with Nail.
 Bulma wonders where Krillin and Goku are. Gohan tells her that Krillin cannot be revived a second time, and that his father stayed on Namek to fight Frieza. Dende then informs the Earthlings that the Namekian Dragon Balls can revive someone multiple times. Piccolo says that Goku must have a death wish to want to fight Frieza, but Gohan tells him that Goku became a Super Saiyan. Vegeta is shocked to hear this. On Namek, Frieza is still alive despite only having his upper torso and one arm remaining. He floats over to Goku, who tells him to leave and learn the value of life. Frieza tells him that he will die in space.
 Goku responds that he will take Frieza's Spaceship, but Frieza tells him that Vegeta destroyed it. Goku is still adamant that he will survive. As Goku flies away, Frieza uses the energy that Goku gave him to attack with his Last Emperor. Goku counters with his Angry Kamehameha, and his blast overpowers Frieza's, seemingly destroying the tyrant. After giving one last look downwards, Goku flies away to find a means of escape.

 King Kai tells the Dragon Team on his planet that Goku has finally defeated Frieza. Tien Shinhan says that Goku must now be the strongest being in the universe, but King Kai says that Goku will die unless he finds a way off of Namek. Yamcha says that Goku will escape, and King Kai urges him to hurry. On Namek, Goku manages to find Frieza's Spaceship. Although he is able to figure out the controls, the ship refuses to move, and Goku is forced to flee when the ground below the ship begins to collapse.
 Namek explodes Watching frantically, King Kai relays the news that Frieza's ship would not take off. Realizing he can do nothing to stop the explosion, Goku screams in anger. King Kai says that he cannot watch, while Yamcha yells for Goku not to die. The planet then explodes, and when the explosion is complete. King Kai says that Goku has perished. Yamcha volunteers to tell Bulma so that she can break the news to Gohan. Yamcha speaks telepathically to Bulma through King Kai. He tells her that Goku defeated Frieza, which she enthusiastically tells the others. However, she does not seem very upset upon hearing that Goku has died, which Yamcha chastises her for. Bulma then informs him of the Namekian Dragon Balls' ability to revive someone multiple times. King Kai then states that Goku and Krillin would be revived where Namek was, which is now empty space, and thus would immediately die again. The apparent hopelessness of the situation leaves Bulma stunned.

Where is Goku?,329 (DBZ 135),"The cover features Super Saiyan Goku standing in the foreground, with Porunga and Shenron in the background.
 Porunga is summoned to revive Goku and Krillin Bulma dejectedly tells Gohan that Goku and Krillin cannot be brought back to life, since their bodies would simply appear where Namek used to be. Vegeta suggests that they try wishing the pair's souls back to Earth before reviving them. Bulma says the idea is brilliant, and Gohan thanks Vegeta, extending his hand for a handshake. Vegeta slaps Gohan's hand away, and thinks to himself that he only wants to see a Super Saiyan. Moori asks Bulma to find the Namekians a place to stay while they search for a new planet. Bulma tells them that they can stay at Capsule Corporation, an offer which she extends to Vegeta as well. Though he is seemingly displeased with Bulma's mannerisms, he does not object. Gohan meekly asks to stay with Bulma as well, telling her that he has not done his homework and that his mom will get mad at him.
 130 days (a Namekian year) later, the Namekian Dragon Balls are used to summon Porunga. The wish to bring the souls of Goku and Krillin to Earth is made, but Porunga says that he can only summon Krillin's, as Goku is still alive. Krillin is wished back to life, and Bulma then asks Porunga to bring Goku to Earth. Porunga says that he cannot, as Goku refuses to come and will return on his own. Master Roshi jokingly says that Goku refuses to return because he's afraid of his wife, prompting an enraged Chi-Chi to threaten him with bodily harm. Piccolo suggests wishing someone back to life from King Kai's Planet, and Yamcha is chosen so that Tien and Chiaotzu can remain together. 130 days later, they are wished back to life as well, and the Namekians use the third wish to find themselves a new world to call home.
 Mecha Frieza and King Cold in their spaceship heading towards Earth A year later, Goku has still not returned. Gohan, while studying one day, wonders why his father won't come back. Just then, he senses a massive ki. He calls Krillin, who has sensed it as well and says that they have seen it before. A shocked King Kai believes the ki belongs to Frieza. The rest of the Dragon Team, in their various locations on the planet, sense the ki as well. Tien notes that there are actually two kis. Onboard King Cold's Spaceship, Frieza, who has been converted into a cyborg following the critical injuries he sustained at Goku's hand, tells his father that they have arrived at Earth before Goku. King Cold says that the planet could be destroyed with one blast, but Frieza says that he wants to show Goku his improved self by slaughtering his friends and family. Back on Earth, Gohan hurriedly dons his Battle Armor, much to Chi-Chi's frustration.

Yamcha and Vegeta, coming from Capsule Corporation, have already arrived at where they believe Frieza will land. Bulma and Puar soon arrive in a small airplane, having come because Bulma wants to see Frieza (having not gotten a chance to do so on Namek). Yamcha chastises her for coming, due to the danger involved, but Bulma is defiant. Tien Shinhan and Chiaotzu then arrive. Tien and Vegeta briefly have words, but Yamcha convinces them to get along for the moment.
 King Cold's spaceship about to land, much to the horror of the Z Fighters Vegeta tells the others to suppress their power levels, as Frieza and his men have scouters. He says that Piccolo, being a true warrior, has done so already. Yamcha, Tien, and Chiaotzu then notice Piccolo standing on a nearby hill. Just then Gohan and Krillin arrive as well, and Yamcha notes that this means Goku has not yet returned. Piccolo then notices King Cold's spaceship and alerts the others. Vegeta says that they must walk over rather than fly. As the ship lands, Yamcha and Tien are stunned by the massive kis that they feel, but Gohan tells them that Frieza can get much stronger. Vegeta and Piccolo say that they must fight, even though the situation seems hopeless.
 Meanwhile, Frieza and King Cold have exited the spaceship, and Frieza comments that Earth is not a bad planet. King Cold asks Frieza if he will wait for Goku to arrive in three hours, and Frieza replies that he will. Frieza says that he will kill all of the Earthlings first, so that Goku will be upset. King Cold says that he only cares about killing Goku so that they remain the most powerful, which Frieza says he can do now that he is stronger. Just as Frieza orders his men to go and kill all the Earthlings they can find, a mysterious person lands in front of the two tyrants.

Frieza laughs this off and says that ignorance is bliss, but is surprised when Future Trunks asks if he is Frieza. Frieza says that although he is honored to be known in the outskirts of the galaxy, he is the most powerful being in the universe. He tells one of his soldiers to kill Future Trunks. The soldier, whose scouter tells him that Future Trunks has a power level of only 5, eagerly shoots. Future Trunks easily deflects the blast and defeats the soldier with a single blow. Frieza is still unfazed, and the rest of the soldiers attack. Future Trunks defeats them all quickly, and the Dragon Team are shocked when they feel his ki from the battle. Krillin, noting that a bunch of kis disappeared, wonders what is happening.
 Future Trunks slices Mecha Frieza in half Future Trunks then states that he will kill Frieza and King Cold. Frieza says the half-strong die first, and that he will show Future Trunks the hard way, but Future Trunks says that he knows he will win. Future Trunks tells Frieza to bring everything he has, since he is not a pushover like Goku. Frieza is surprised that Future Trunks knows about Goku, and Future Trunks says that Frieza made a miscalculation in thinking that Goku was the only Super Saiyan. He then becomes a Super Saiyan himself, much to Frieza's shock. The Z Fighters are stunned by the massive ki, which Gohan says is similar to Goku's when he became a Super Saiyan.
 Frieza then fires a Ki Blast at Future Trunks, who easily dodges and gets behind his opponents. He yells out to Frieza, and then unleashes a Burning Attack.

King Cold tells Future Trunks that his feat was impressive, and offers him a spot in the Frieza Force. Future Trunks immediately declines, and King Cold then asks to see his sword. After a momentary hesitation, Future Trunks tosses him the sword, which Cold says has a fine edge. Believing that the sword was what allowed Future Trunks to beat Frieza, Cold attacks with the sword. However, Future Trunks easily grabs the sword by its blade, then hits Cold in the chest with a God Breaker.

He says that there are still three hours until Goku arrives, and that he has brought drinks for everyone. Bulma, Gohan, and Krillin take him up on his offer.
 Goku arrives back home The Z Fighters begin to question Future Trunks about how he knows Goku and how he became so powerful. Future Trunks refuses to disclose much information, simply telling them that he has never actually met Goku and that he was indeed a Super Saiyan when he defeated Frieza and King Cold. Bulma notices the Capsule Corporation logo on the youth's jacket and asks for more information, but the youth only reveals that he is 17 years old. Tien and Yamcha ask for the youth's name, but Bulma tells them to stop bothering him. Gohan then asks Piccolo why he did not go with the other Namekians to New Namek, and Piccolo responds that he did not want a boring life, and tells Gohan that he trains every day.
 Bulma comments to Krillin that Vegeta also trains every day, and asks if Krillin also thinks that Vegeta and the youth seem similar, but Krillin finds their personalities to be opposite. Vegeta sees Future Trunks looking at him, and asks what he is looking at, and Future Trunks does not respond. The group idly passes the time for the rest of the three hours. Future Trunks then suddenly declares that Goku should be arriving, and the group feels a large ki approaching. An Attack Ball with a Ginyu Force logo lands nearby, creating a large crater. Goku emerges dressed in a strange outfit, and is puzzled that his friends are there. Gohan asks if Goku knows the youth, and the Z Fighters are surprised when Goku asks who he is.

When Piccolo tells him that the boy became a Super Saiyan and defeated Frieza, Goku is excited, and says that he did not know there were other Saiyans.

Goku then reveals to Future Trunks that he has learned Instant Transmission from the inhabitants of Yardrat. Future Trunks is upset that he changed history for no reason, and the mention of this puzzles Goku. Future Trunks then asks Goku if he can become a Super Saiyan at will. When Goku says he can,Future Trunks asks him to do it, and Goku complies. The Dragon Team marvel at Goku's ki, and then Future Trunks becomes a Super Saiyan as well. Trunks then unexpectedly attacks Goku with his sword, but stops just short. Goku, however, does not even attempt to dodge, saying that he could not feel any malice behind the blow.
 Future Trunks grins, then tells Goku that he will not stop this time. He attacks again, and Goku stops a flurry of sword blows with just his finger. Satisfied, Future Trunks reverts to his base form and says that Goku is even greater than the stories he heard. Tien, Yamcha, and Vegeta are visibly shocked by what they have seen.

The Terrifying Message,335 (DBZ 141),"The cover features Future Trunks, Gohan, Goku, Piccolo, Vegeta, Bulma, Yamcha, Chiaotzu, and Tien Shinhan in the Northern Wastelands.
 Although Goku says that he cannot see Vegeta as a father, he admits that Future Trunks does resemble Vegeta. Future Trunks tells Goku that he will be born in two and a half years, but that he has come to discuss more serious business. He informs Goku that in three years, on May 12, a pair of powerful monsters will appear on an island near South City. Goku, considering his most recent battles, asks if they're aliens. Trunks says that the duo are really cyborgs created by Dr. Gero, the chief scientist for the Red Ribbon Army - the now defunct organization Goku defeated more than a decade ago as a child. Goku, shocked to learn that they have resurfaced, asks if they (Gero specifically) are attempting world conquest again. Future Trunks says that he's not sure but believes so. He then says that the two cyborgs, called ""Mechanical Men Nos. 19 & 20,"" killed Dr. Gero. Goku is surprised that someone who defeated Frieza so easily could be frightened, realizing that these cyborgs are stronger than the tyrant himself. He asks if the others could help, but Future Trunks informs Goku that he is the only Z Fighter left on Earth in his time.
 Future Trunks and Goku discussing Future Trunks proceeds to tell Goku that all of the other Z Fighters except for Gohan will be killed shortly after the cyborgs appear. He says that Gohan was the one who trained him, but that even he will perish at the cyborgs' hands. He also tells him that when Piccolo dies, the Dragon Balls will disappear forever as nobody can be revived again. Goku asks what will happen to him and also asks if he got killed by the androids too, and Future Trunks tells him that he never got killed by the androids, but he will die of a heart virus before the androids appear. Goku says that he is disappointed that he will not get to fight the cyborgs, which shocks Future Trunks. He tells Goku that he is a true Super Saiyan just like his mother told him, and then gives Goku the Heart Medicine, telling him that there is a cure in his time, but tells him to keep it safe with him as there isn't a cure in this era. Goku is overjoyed, and Future Trunks tells him that he has faith in him to fix things, and that his mother worked on the time machine so that Goku could help.
 Goku, upon hearing that Future Trunks' mother knows him and made the time machine, quickly deduces that it must be Bulma. Goku is stunned, and Future Trunks explains that Yamcha was unfaithful to Bulma, which led to their breakup and Bulma falling in love with Vegeta. He also says that his parents never married, and that this is the first time he has gotten to see his father. He makes Goku promise not to reveal his parentage, lest it jeopardize his existence. Future Trunks decides to return to the future to reassure his mother. Goku asks if they will meet again. Future Trunks says that it takes a while to build up power in the time machine, but that he will return to fight with them if he is still alive. Goku promises to train hard and Future Trunks flies off. Goku is unsure how to deliver the news to the rest of the Z Fighters, but is relieved of having to do so due to Piccolo's exceptional hearing. Piccolo tells the group everything except for Future Trunks' parentage. Yamcha and Bulma seem skeptical of the story, but Piccolo says that he will train. Just then, Future Trunks' time machine rises into the air and then disappears. This convinces Krillin, Tien Shinhan, and Vegeta of the story's credibility, and they decide to train for the battle.
"
The Risky Decision,336 (DBZ 142),"The cover features the Dragon Team training for the battle against the Androids.
 With the Dragon Team having made their decision to train for the upcoming battle with the androids, Vegeta asks Goku how he escaped from Namek. Yamcha recalls King Kai saying that Goku was not going to make it as Frieza's Spaceship would not work. Goku says that he found five space pods nearby, which Vegeta realizes belonged to the Ginyu Force. Goku says that the pod took him to Yardrat, which Vegeta says the Ginyu Force were set to conquer next. Goku even told them that the people of Yardrat were really friendly, and they gave him an outfit identical to the one they wear since his outfit got all torn up from his battle with Frieza. Vegeta says that the people of Yardrat have strange techniques, and that Goku would not have left without learning one. Goku confirms this idea, and claims that he has learned teleportation.
 To prove the truth of his claim, Goku teleports to Kame House, takes Master Roshi's sunglasses and then returns, amazing the rest of the group. Tien Shinhan asks where and when they should reconvene in three years. Goku does not remember, but Piccolo informs the group, saying that they should meet an hour early. Piccolo says that anyone who does not think they stand a chance should not come, which Vegeta says applies to Piccolo. Bulma defuses the situation by suggesting they attack Dr. Gero right away by asking Shenron for his location. Krillin likes the idea, but Vegeta threatens to kill Bulma if she does so. Goku says that he wants to fight as well, and so does Tien. Even Krillin agrees, saying that a common enemy will keep Vegeta at bay. Bulma is aghast at their decision. The group then splits up to train. Goku, Piccolo and Gohan decide to train together, as do Tien and Chiaotzu, while Krillin and Yamcha opt to train with Master Roshi. Vegeta claims that he will also become a Super Saiyan before flying off. Goku tells Bulma to take care of her baby, which Yamcha interprets as Goku hinting that the two of them should marry and start a family.
 At Capsule Corporation, Vegeta asks Dr. Brief to build him a 300G training room. Goku then tries to convince Chi-Chi to let Gohan train instead of study. Chi-Chi angrily refuses, only for Goku to accidentally send her flying through a wall with a friendly pat on the back. Chi-Chi then reluctantly agrees, but makes Goku promise to give up martial arts after the androids are defeated. Piccolo believes this is one battle that Goku can't win. Vegeta, inside his training room, vows to surpass even the Super Saiyan level. The chapter then skips ahead three years, and Goku, Gohan and Piccolo fly off to meet the androids on the day that Trunks claimed they would arrive.

He thinks that he has trained and gotten stronger too, but not like a Super Saiyan.
 Android 19 and Android 20 at Sasebo When they arrive on the island, they are greeted by Yamcha, Tien Shinhan, and Bulma, who is carrying a baby. Goku says that it is too dangerous for her to be there, but she says that she wants to see the androids first and then she will leave. Krillin and Gohan are surprised to see that she has a baby and Gohan assumes that it belongs to Yamcha. He nonchalantly says that he is not the father, and that he and Bulma broke up a long time ago. Goku says that Vegeta is the father and the baby's name is Trunks, which shocks Gohan and Krillin. Bulma asks how he knew that, as she has not told anyone yet. Goku laughs it off and says that he was guessing. Piccolo asks where Vegeta is. Bulma does not know, since they are not living together, but knows he will come because he has been training intensely for the battle. Goku says that Vegeta will definitely come. The Dragon Team notice that the time is 9:30. To pass the time, Krillin and Gohan entertain Trunks. When 10:00 comes and goes, they wonder why the androids have not arrived. Gohan believes that they cannot sense the androids because they do not have ki. Yajirobe arrives with Senzu Beans for the Z Fighters, but refuses to fight with them when they ask for his assistance. When he leaves, his hovercar explodes, and they realize that the androids have finally arrived.

Goku instructs the group to spread out and search for them, but to let the others know as soon as they find anything. He also tells Gohan to tend to Yajirobe, who is still alive. The group splits up, and Goku wishes that Future Trunks had brought them a picture, while Krillin's ability to fly is noticed by a shocked citizen. Gohan reaches Yajirobe, who asks what the things were that shot down his hovercar.
 Gohan goes to Yajirobe while the others search the city Meanwhile, the androids walk through Sasebo. A nearby pedestrian asks his friend if he saw the hovercar that exploded in the sky. Upon hearing this, Android 19 walks up to the man and headbutts him, then punches his friend. Android 20, standing in the middle of the road, is nearly hit by a car, the driver of which tells him to get out of the road. Android 20 responds by putting his hand through the car's hood, then pulling the driver out by the window and crushing his neck. A nearby woman screams, and Yamcha hears her and begins to run towards the sound. 19 and 20 detect Yamcha's ki, and determine that it is not a sensor malfunction as they both detect it. 19 believes that they have already found Goku.
 Android 20 drives his hand through Yamcha while draining his energy Upon arriving at the scene, Yamcha finds the two dead men, but the androids are nowhere in sight. He asks a nearby citizen if he saw who killed the two men, and the man responds that it was two strange-looking people, who then disappeared. Floating in the air above, Android 19 says that they have not found Goku, and that there is a 96% chance, based on their data, that they have found Yamcha. 20 says that he will be a good source of power. As Yamcha debates whether to alert the others or not, the androids land behind him. Hearing them land, Yamcha is alerted to their presence and turns around. He asks if they saw where the murderers went before realizing that they are the androids. As Yamcha begins to yell out, 20 puts his hand over his mouth. He lifts Yamcha into the air, and Yamcha feels his energy being drained away. He then drives his hand through Yamcha's chest.

Krillin realizes that Yamcha is in trouble, and Piccolo spots the androids. The four quickly arrive at the scene to find Android 20 still holding Yamcha and Android 19 looking on. Android 20 drops the bleeding Yamcha on the ground, and Goku tells Krillin to take Yamcha and get him a Senzu Bean. Krillin complies, grabbing Yamcha and flying away. Piccolo says that they finally get to see the androids after all of their training. Android 20 is surprised that the Z Fighters know they are mechanical. He says that the Z Fighters also seemed to know where he and Android 19 would be, and asks how this is possible. Piccolo refuses, saying that they will have to obtain the information by force.
 Android 20 uses his Bionic Punisher destroy large portions of the city Android 20 says that they will do just that, but Goku requests that they move to a deserted area, as there are too many people around. Android 20 says that a deserted area is fine, but that they will not need to move. He then fires a Bionic Punisher at the surrounding city, destroying a large portion of it. An enraged Goku tells the android to stop and charges in, hitting Android 20 in the head with a punch and knocking off his hat in the process. A seemingly organic brain is revealed underneath. Meanwhile, Yamcha is restored by a Senzu Bean and is aghast at the destruction that the androids have caused.
 Back at the battle, Goku calls Android 20 a monster, but Android 20 responds that Goku wanted a deserted area and that he was just trying to please. Goku tells the androids to follow them, and that they will tear the pair to pieces. Android 19 tells Goku that he and Android 20 cannot be defeated, and Android 20 tells Goku to choose his place of death. Piccolo wonders how Android 20 knows Goku's name, and Android 20 says that he knows them all, naming Piccolo and Tien as well. Police sirens are heard approaching, and Goku says that they can ask questions later, then takes off. The androids, Piccolo, and Tien follow him. Krillin, Yamcha, and Gohan, watching from the cliff, are surprised to see the androids following Goku.

 Goku, Piccolo, Tien Shinhan, and the androids fly off Amenbo Island to find a suitable location to battle. Yamcha tells the others that that Android 20 was able to take his energy just by grabbing him. Bulma says that Dr. Gero must be a phenomenal scientist, and Gohan says that they must inform the others, then takes off in pursuit. Yamcha says that he cannot go, as he felt so powerless against the androids. Krillin says that he will go, at least to take the Senzu Beans to the others, and Yamcha then decides to follow along just to watch. Bulma then asks Yajirobe why he will not go, since he is supposedly tough and both his friends and the Earth are in danger. Yajirobe says that he knows this, and Bulma then berates him for not caring. Yajirobe then tells her that he cannot fly, and Bulma apologizes.
 As the group with the androids flies over a deserted plain, Android 20 says they will fight there, as it is not Goku's choice where they do battle. Goku does not object, and the group lands. Piccolo realizes that the plain is surrounded by rocky mountains, and that the androids are planning on hiding among these if necessary. Goku then asks how the androids know about then, and Tien notices that Goku is breathing hard after just flying. Android 20 tells Goku that they have been watching his battles ever since he defeated the Red Ribbon Army, looking for a weakness. 20 says that only Dr. Gero remained after the Army's defeat, and Piccolo says that 20 is talking like Gero himself. 20 denies this, saying that Dr. Gero is no more.
 Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan in front of the Androids Goku then asks if they observed his battles on Namek, and Android 20 responds that they had sufficient data by that time and thus did not. As Gohan, Krillin, and Yamcha search fruitlessly for the battle site, Goku tells Android 20 that he has missed something. Android 20 and Android 19 are surprised to hear this, and Piccolo says that it is a fatal mistake not to know about the Super Saiyan. Goku then powers up and transforms, and the burst of ki alerts the other group to the location of the battle. Tien and Piccolo are amazed at Goku's power as a Super Saiyan, and 20 admits that Goku has far exceeded his calculated limits. However, he says that both he and 19 can still handle Goku.

 As Goku hits Android 19 again, Android 20 is concerned that Android 19 will run out of energy before he can absorb any of Goku's power. Just then Gohan, Yamcha, and Krillin arrive at the battlefield. Gohan seems concerned for his father, but Tien tells them not to worry, as the androids are no match for Goku's Super Saiyan power. Goku continues to clobber 19, and Yamcha wonders if the energy absorption was just his imagination. Gohan, however, seems confused about something, and Piccolo asks if he has noticed as well. Gohan says yes, and Piccolo says that Goku is rushing the battle and is weak. Tien is surprised, saying that Goku is overwhelming the android, but Piccolo says that Goku's power should be much higher. Gohan mentions Yamcha's energy absorption theory, which surprises Piccolo. Yamcha relates his experience with Android 20.
 Android 19 absorbs Goku's Kamehameha Just then Goku kicks Android 19, sending him crashing to the ground. Android 19 gets up and stares at Goku, and Yamcha comments how he does not seem to care about the beating he is taking. Tien says that he cannot feel pain or fatigue because he is an android. Goku, visibly exhausted, decides to try to finish 19 with a Kamehameha. Upon seeing the blast, 19 and 20 are overjoyed, and 19 simply absorbs the blast with his right hand. The Dragon Team are shocked, and Yamcha notes that he was correct. Piccolo yells to Goku not to use Ki Blasts, as the androids can absorb them. Goku, breathing even more heavily, is displeased to hear this. Krillin notes that Goku is acting strangely and wonders if a lot of his ki has already been drained, but Piccolo notes that 19 has not grabbed him at all. Gohan seemingly has a revelation, while 20 notes that 19's power has increased while Goku's has dramatically decreased. Rejuvenated, 19 again charges head first at Goku.
"
One Down...,342 (DBZ 148),"The cover of the chapter features a tired looking Super Saiyan Goku clutching his chest.
 Android 19, rejuvenated from absorbing Goku's Kamehameha, charges head first at Goku. Although he is visibly exhausted, Goku dodges 19's first punch and attempts to elbow the android, but 19 dodges. 19 knees Goku in the stomach and Goku elbows 19 in the face. 19 seems unaffected by the elbow, and smacks Goku in the face before slamming him downwards. Goku manages to stop just before he would have hit the ground, and prepares to fire a Kamehameha at 19. Piccolo yells at Goku to stop, which he does. Yamcha notes that Goku seems to be in pain, and wonders if he is weakening. Goku then grabs his chest, and Gohan realizes that he was correct in his belief that Goku is being affected by the Heart Virus. He announces this, and Piccolo remembers what Future Trunks told them. Krillin thinks that this cannot be right, as the Heart Medicine would have stopped this, and throws Goku a Senzu Bean to restore his ki.
 As Goku wonders what is wrong with his body, Android 19 lands. Goku catches the Senzu thrown by Krillin, and says that it has saved him. Android 20 realizes that the bean is indeed the legendary Senzu, and Yamcha is now again optimistic about Goku's chances. 19 resumes the battle by firing Eye Lasers at Goku. Goku emerges from the explosion that they cause, but 19 appears in front of him and punches him into the air. When Goku lands, he is again visibly exhausted, and the Dragon Team realize that the Senzu did not work. Gohan says that it is his heart, and Krillin asks why the medicine did not heal him. Gohan tells him that since Goku never got sick, he never took the medicine. 19 kicks Goku, sending him hurtling backwards, and Goku reverts to his base form, unable to stay a Super Saiyan. 19 jumps, landing on Goku's chest and grabbing him by the neck.
 As Goku unsuccessfully attempts to remove the android's arm from his neck, the rest of the Z Fighters fly forward to help. However, they are intercepted by Android 20, who tells them that they will not be getting an inch past him, although they can try if they want. Piccolo says that he will and kicks at 20, but 20 dodges and hits Piccolo with Eye Lasers. Piccolo falls to the ground, and 20 says that his actions were stupid. As the Z Fighters marvel at 20's speed, 19 continues to drain energy from Goku. However, he is interrupted by a kick to the face, which sends him flying backwards. Everyone looks in the direction of the blow to see Vegeta. The Saiyan prince says that he will be the one to defeat Kakarot, and will not lose his revenge to a bunch of cheap toys.

Vegeta Returns!!!,343 (DBZ 149),"The cover of the chapter features Vegeta on the left side, and three images on the left side: Android 20 in front of Tien Shinhan, Krillin, and Yamcha on the top image, Android 19 on the image in the middle, and Gohan aiding an injured Piccolo on the bottom image.
 The Dragon Team and the androids are both stunned by the sudden appearance of Vegeta. Piccolo, lying on the ground, suddenly get up. He reveals that he was simply faking defeat, telling Gohan that it would take more than one blast to beat him. Vegeta says that he saw everything, and tells Goku that he is a fool for turning Super Saiyan even though he noticed the anomaly in his body. He tells Goku that he has always been his target, and kicks Goku forward into the air. Piccolo grabs him, and Vegeta says that someone should drag Goku home and give him the Heart Medicine. Gohan volunteers to do so, but Yamcha says that he will, as he seems to be the least useful one there. Piccolo tells Yamcha to take some of the medicine as well, as the virus could be contagious. As Yamcha flies off, Android 19 watches and prepares to give chase, but Android 20 tells him not to, as it could be fun to save the best for last.
 The sleeper has awakened... 20 says that they can take care of the rest of the Z Fighters now, and that things will be more interesting since Vegeta has joined them. Krillin suggests retreating for the time being, citing Future Trunks' description of how everyone except for Gohan died. Gohan says that if they do so the androids will run wild, while Piccolo notes that things have already happened differently from Future Trunks' timeline. Piccolo says that Trunks' presence probably changed history in subtle ways, such as with the timing of Goku's Heart Virus, but Krillin is still afraid. 19 asks if he can kill Vegeta, and 20 agrees after calling him greedy and saying that he will take the other four. Vegeta tells 19 that from his observations, the androids are not as strong as they were said to be. He tells 19 that he knows about their energy absorption through the palms, but 19 replies that he already knows Vegeta's abilities. Vegeta says that Saiyans cannot be reduced to numbers and wonders if androids can feel fear, then transforms into a Super Saiyan.
 The Z Fighters and androids are both surprised at this development, and Krillin says that he thought a Super Saiyan had to have a pure heart. Vegeta says that his heart is pure, but pure evil. He tells how he endured a brutal training regimen before reaching his own limits, and became a Super Saiyan due to his rage against himself. Android 20 tells Vegeta that he is still no match for them, and 19 charges towards Vegeta. He connects with a punch to the face, but Vegeta is unfazed. He tells 19 that his ferocity has increased as well, and that Super Saiyans are in a certain ecstatic state. He tells 19 he is lucky not to feel pain, then kicks the android in the chest. He follows up with an elbow to the face and another kick, which sends 19 flying backwards. Vegeta calmly walks over to the android as 20 watches in horror.
"
The Androids Unhinged,344 (DBZ 150),"
 
 The cover of the chapter features a scene from the manga: Super Saiyan Vegeta walking towards Android 19, with a concerned Android 20.
 Vegeta confidently walks over to Android 19, who is still lying on the ground. He asks the android if his scrap-metal brain messed up its calculations. Android 19 then leaps to his feet and flies head first at Vegeta, who leans back to dodge and kicks Android 19 into the air. Vegeta gives chase and quickly reaches Android 19, surprising the android. Android 19 punches, but Vegeta dodges and hits him in the face. Noticing that Android 19 is bleeding, Vegeta sarcastically asks if the liquid is blood or oil. Android 19 attacks Vegeta with a Bionic Punisher, but Vegeta dodges and slams the android to the ground. The Dragon Team dodge Android 19's falling body, which makes a sizable crater as it hits the ground.
 Vegeta's Big Bang Attack With Android 19 lying motionless in the crater, Vegeta lands near him. Just then Android 19 opens his eyes and leaps up, grabbing Vegeta's wrists with his hands. He tells Vegeta that he will drain all his power, and that kicking is useless as he will never let go. Vegeta decides to test this by putting his feet against Android 19's face and stretching his body. He says that 19 does indeed drain energy through his hands, and Android 19 says that he will never let go. However, Vegeta then fully extends his body, and 19's hands are severed at the wrists, still clinging to Vegeta. Having been sent falling backwards, Android 19 is shocked, as is Android 20. Vegeta removes Android 19's hands from his wrists and examines them, noticing the energy absorption areas on the palms. He tosses Android 19's hands to the ground and asks if he can feel fear. Android 19 scrambles out of the crater and begins to run away. Vegeta rises into the air and prepares to destroy Android 19 when Android 20 verbally intercedes. Vegeta tells him that he will deal with him after.
 As Vegeta begins to power up, the Z Fighters wonder what he is doing. After powering up sufficiently, he unleashes a Big Bang Attack, which creates a massive explosion, stunning the onlookers. When the smoke clears, only Android 19's head remains. Android 20 says that they may have miscalculated, but Vegeta still has no chance of victory, a notion at which Vegeta scoffs.
"
A Change of Plans,345 (DBZ 151),"The cover of the chapter features Vegeta in his base form smiling in the foreground, with Android 20 in the background with a look of concern on his face.
 Having destroyed Android 19, Vegeta lands near Android 20. Vegeta powers down to his base form and tells Android 20 that he has lost a lot of energy, and that this is his chance to defeat him. Android 20 wonders what sort of trick Vegeta is trying to pull. Vegeta asks why Android 20 said he had no hope, and Android 20 tells Vegeta that he has exceeded their calculations. Vegeta says that he is being a sore loser. Android 20 then runs away, heading for the nearby rocks as Piccolo had feared earlier. Vegeta demands a Senzu Bean from Krillin, but Krillin is reluctant to hand one over. Piccolo tells him to do it, and Krillin complies. Vegeta then becomes Super Saiyan once again, and tells the Dragon Team to stay out of his way. He then takes off after Android 20.
 Vegeta eats a Senzu Bean and turns Super Saiyan again Piccolo tells the others that Vegeta really did lose a lot of his power against Android 19, and that he was just bluffing against Android 20. Piccolo says that he is truly a great warrior, and may even have surpassed Goku, which surprises the others. Tien Shinhan says that he is following Vegeta to see Android 20 get destroyed. Krillin and Gohan decide to follow as well, and Piccolo tells them not to fight Android 20, but to alert him or Vegeta if they find him. The Z Fighters then fly after Vegeta. Vegeta, meanwhile, has not yet found Android 20, and yells for the android to show himself. He decides to attempt to flush 20 out, and flies into the air and unleashes Photon Bomber towards the ground. Krillin yells for him to stop, as they are also there. Seeing his chance, Android 20 steps in front of the blast and absorbs it through his palms.
 Seeing this, Vegeta is upset and darts towards Android 20, who quickly disappears. Vegeta chases after him, but is upset to discover that Android 20 is quicker and manages to leave his sight. Android 20, watching from above, says that the Z Fighters have become too dependent on tracking ki and have lost their eyes for movement. However, he admits that he did not count on so much power from Vegeta. Although he believes the most logical option is to return to his lab, he wants to avoid that if at all possible. He then spots Gohan, Tien, Piccolo, and Krillin, and decides to steal their energy and then defeat Vegeta.
"
Trunks Returns!,346 (DBZ 152),"The cover of the chapter features Piccolo standing in the foreground without his weighted clothing, with a rocky area of the Southern Continent in the background.
 The Dragon Team continue their search in the mountains for Android 20. Having decided to steal energy from the others before fighting Vegeta, Android 20 chooses to attack Piccolo first, as he is the strongest after Vegeta. He ambushes Piccolo from behind, and covers his mouth so that he cannot call for help. Android 20 tells Piccolo that the others cannot see them, as he knows where they all are. However, Piccolo telepathically calls out to Gohan, who detects the subtle change in his ki and flies over to help. As Android 20 tells Piccolo that he is almost out of energy, Gohan arrives and hits Android 20 from behind, knocking him off of Piccolo. Krillin, Tien Shinhan, and Vegeta sense Gohan's ki, and surround Android 20 upon reaching the area.
 Piccolo cuts off Android 20's hand Android 20 is surprised at the arrival of the other Z Fighters, and Gohan tells Krillin to give Piccolo a Senzu Bean, which he does. Piccolo then descends down to face Android 20, removing his weighted clothing. He tells Vegeta not to interfere. Vegeta responds that he does not care if Piccolo gets killed, but says that he will only be giving Android 20 more energy. Android 20 thinks to himself that this is another chance to absorb energy, but Piccolo quickly reaches him and knees him in the face. Android 20 is knocked back, and the others are surprised by Piccolo's speed. Android 20 charges at Piccolo, but Piccolo elbows him into the ground below. After regaining his composure, Android 20 thinks that this is impossible, as he was more powerful than Piccolo before he absorbed Vegeta's energy.
 Meanwhile, Future Trunks has returned to help the Z Fighters combat the androids. Not seeing the androids or the Z Fighters on Amenbo Island, he thinks that he was too late, but wonders what happened there. He says that he wishes he could go back further in time, but only has enough energy to get home and cannot risk any inaccuracies. Just then, he senses the ki from the ongoing battle, and flies off in that direction. Among the mountains, Piccolo is continuing to beat Android 20, and Krillin wonders what kind of training he has been doing. On their way towards the explosion in an airplane, Bulma and Yajirobe discuss whether to actually go near or not. Yajirobe tells Bulma not to, as she has Trunks with her. Future Trunks flies by their plane, and Bulma recognizes him, leading her to believe they are heading in the right direction. At the battle, Piccolo chops off Android 20's right hand, and tells him that what he stole before was nothing. Future Trunks then arrives at the site of the battle with Android 19, and upon seeing its head, wonders what it is.

A Sound of Thunder,347 (DBZ 153),"The cover of the chapter features Future Trunks on the foreground, with an image of Android 19's severed head on the top and an image of Android 20 without his hat on the bottom.
 Seeing Android 19's head lying on the ground, Future Trunks says that this is not right, and wonders what is going on. Just then he sees an explosion at the site of battle, and flies off towards it. As he flies, he notes that Android 19 is not one of the androids he knows, and wonders if there are now three. Back at the battle, Piccolo is still easily handling Android 20, who wonders how Piccolo exceeded their calculations. Piccolo says that regardless of whether the androids were not as strong as expected or the Dragon Team became too strong, the future has now been changed. Tien Shinhan says that he does not like Piccolo and Vegeta being so powerful, but that it is good for the moment. Vegeta tells Piccolo to finish Android 20, and Piccolo says that he will, as he is not soft like Goku.
 Future Trunks saves his present counterpart and his mother while Vegeta is after Android 20 Just then everyone senses a ki approaching, and Future Trunks arrives on the scene. Piccolo calls him by name, and Vegeta realizes that Future Trunks is his son from the future. Trunks notes that he does not recognize Android 20 either, and Android 20 wonders who Trunks is. He decides to return to his laboratory, thinking that he has miscalculated too much. Trunks asks who Android 20 is, and whether they were fighting him. Vegeta tells Trunks that they are fighting the androids he told them about, but Trunks seems confused. Piccolo asks if these are not the androids, and the others are confused as well. Meanwhile, Bulma, Yajirobe, and Trunks continue to approach the battleground. Yajirobe threatens to throw Trunks out the window if they get closer, but Bulma tells him that Vegeta is the father and he acquiesces.
 Future Trunks asks him why he did not try to save Bulma and his son As the discussion about the androids continues, Krillin suggests that the androids are different since history has changed. Android 20 decides to escape by hiding among the rocks. Just then Bulma and Yajirobe arrive, and Android 20 yells out that Androids 17 and 18 will come for them soon, then hits Bulma's airplane with a Photon Wave. The airplane explodes, and Android 20 is gone when the smoke clears. Future Trunks manages to save Bulma and his younger self, and Vegeta decides to go after Android 20. However, Future Trunks gets in front of Vegeta and asks him why he did not try to save Bulma and his son. Vegeta says that he has no use for sentiment, and flies away. Bulma says that she believes Android 20 is actually Dr. Gero, having seen his picture in an academic journal, and wonders if he modified his own body.
"
Dr. Gero's Laboratory,348 (DBZ 154),"The cover of the chapter features Future Trunks, Piccolo, Super Saiyan Vegeta, Bulma with baby Trunks in her arms, Krillin, and Gohan waiting in the rocky area where Piccolo faced Android 20.
 Krillin yells out to the others that Bulma believes Android 20 is really Dr. Gero. Vegeta asks what she means, and Bulma says she has seen Gero's picture before. She says that although Gero is a famous scientist, he is not well-liked among his peers, and that his reason for becoming a cyborg was most likely to live longer. Vegeta tells Future Trunks that everything he told them was not true, as the androids are different and he had told them that they killed Dr. Gero. Future Trunks says that his coming back in time must have changed history, but Piccolo suggests that the Android 17 and Android 18 mentioned by Gero must be the ones Future Trunks knows. He asks Future Trunks to describe the pair, and Future Trunks does so.
 Future Trunks closely follows Vegeta Piccolo then asks if Android 17 and Android 18 can also absorb energy through their hands, but Future Trunks replied that they have an infinite energy supply instead. Future Trunks then asks where Goku is, and Krillin tells him that the Heart Virus just took effect. Vegeta asks Bulma if she knows where Gero's lab is, and Bulma says that it is rumored to be in a cave in the mountains near North City. Piccolo suggests that they attempt to beat Gero to the lab and destroy the androids before they are activated, but Vegeta says that this is the coward's way out. Future Trunks cautions him not to underestimate the androids, and says that if they cannot beat Gero to his lab, they should wait until Goku recovers. Vegeta says that they do not need Goku, and that he does not need anyone at all, before flying away. Piccolo says that he may be able to win, but Future Trunks disagrees, and flies after Vegeta.
 Future Trunks' reference to Vegeta as his father before he leaves catches Bulma's attention, and Piccolo reveals Future Trunks' true identity, which shocks Bulma, Krillin, and Gohan. Piccolo then tells Gohan to bring Bulma and Trunks to tell Goku what has transpired, while he, Tien Shinhan, and Krillin try to find the lab before Vegeta. The three take off, and Gohan is preparing to leave with Bulma and Trunks when Yajirobe appears. Meanwhile, as he hides among the rocks, Dr. Gero sees Vegeta and then Future Trunks fly overhead in the direction of his lab. He initially thinks that it must just be coincidence, and that they cannot know its location. However, he then thinks back and recognizes Bulma as the heir to Capsule Corporation, and realizes that they are indeed heading for his lab. He heads off after them, thinking that their need to find its precise location will give him enough time. As they fly, Future Trunks thinks about how Future Bulma told him that there was some good in Vegeta, but Future Trunks refuses to believe it. Vegeta attempts to outpace Future Trunks, but Future Trunks matches his speed by turning Super Saiyan, which Vegeta thinks is not surprising since Future Trunks is his son. Meanwhile, Gohan slowly carries Yajirobe, Bulma, and Trunks

The Androids Awake!,349 (DBZ 155),"The cover of the chapter features Tien Shinhan, Piccolo, and Krillin flying together towards the Northern Mountains.
 Android 17 is awakened Tien Shinhan, Piccolo, and Krillin reach the mountains near North City, and decide to split up in order to find Dr. Gero's Lab. Krillin complains that he is cold, but Tien tells him to ignore it. Krillin suggests that they split the six remaining Senzu Beans, and the others agree. Meanwhile, Vegeta tells Future Trunks to stop bothering him, which Trunks says that he cannot do since Vegeta wants to fight the androids. Vegeta asks if Trunks will fight him if he tries to activate the androids, and Trunks says that he will. Vegeta tells Trunks that a pure Saiyan would want to fight the androids even more after hearing of their power. Dr. Gero, having traveled on foot to avoid being seen, is near his lab as well, and is confident that the Dragon Team will not find his lab easily.
 Tien Shinhan, Piccolo, and Krillin reach the Northern Mountains Dr. Gero quickly reaches his lab, and leaps up into the cave which houses it. As he is about to enter, however, his sensors detect something, and he turns around to see Krillin looking at him. Gero thinks that Krillin will not be able to do anything, and opens the door to his lab. He then tells Krillin that even if he calls the others, they will be too late now. Krillin then raises his ki, and Piccolo, Tien, Vegeta, and Trunks all sense it. Gero, inside his lab, says that he would have preferred not to activate 17 and 18, but that he has no choice now, and hopes that he has fixed the problem that the androids has. He then activates Android 17, while holding his Shut Down Remote. After awakening, Android 17 says good morning to Dr. Gero. When Gero comments on his politeness, Android 17 says that Gero is his creator, though he eyes the remote.
 Android 18 is awakened Relieved that Android 17 appears to be operating properly, Gero then activates Android 18. Android 18 is polite to Gero as well, though she also eyes the remote. She comments on the fact that Gero has made himself into a cyborg, and Gero says that he wanted eternal life. He also says that he previously devoted too much time to their infinite energy reactor, and that they would not obey him. He then relates the new that the Z Fighters are en route, and tells the two cyborgs to kill them all, which they agree to do. The Z Fighters soon arrive and begin attempting to break in. This momentarily distracts Gero, and 17 steals the remote from him. Much to Gero's horror, he then crushes the remote and tells Gero that he will not put them to sleep again. On the outside, Piccolo is about to destroy the door with a Ki Blast when he hears Gero giving orders to Android 17. Tien and Krillin realize in horror that the androids have been activated.

"#17, #18...#16?",350 (DBZ 156),"
 
 The cover of the chapter features Android 18 and Android 17 standing.
 Piccolo is upset that they did not get to Dr. Gero's Lab before the androids were activated, but Vegeta still plans on breaking down the door. Future Trunks tells him not to and that they should wait until Goku recovers. Vegeta ignores him and blasts the door anyways, destroying it. The androids look at the Dragon Team, and Vegeta asks Future Trunks if these are the right androids this time. Future Trunks replies that they are. Krillin is surprised at the androids' appearance, but Future Trunks tells him not to underestimate them. Dr. Gero tells Android 18 and Android 17 to kill the Z Fighters, mentioning that they destroyed Android 19 and almost killed him.
 Android 17 kicks Dr. Gero's head off Upon Gero mentioning Android 19, Android 17 asks if he was an energy absorption model, and Gero replies that he was. Android 18 asks if Gero went back to energy absorption because she and Android 17 were too powerful to control. Dr. Gero tells them that it does not matter now, and orders the pair to kill the Z Fighters. However, Android 17 tells Gero that they will kill them when they want to. Gero is shocked at this, and is even more upset when Android 18 begins inspecting a chamber labeled ""16"". Android 18 asks how the android inside is different from them, but Gero tells her to back off. Future Trunks notes that he has never heard of an Android 16. Android 17 tells Android 18 to activate Android 16, but Gero tells them not to, as 16 was a failure and would put the entire world at risk. Android 18 questions why he kept 16 around, and Gero says he was planning on fixing him later.
 Future Trunks fires a Renzoku Energy Barrage As the androids argue amongst themselves, Krillin suggests that they run. Vegeta tells him to go ahead, as he is the only one who can handle the androids. Android 17 says that he has a much higher power rating than Android 16, and tells Android 18 to activate him. Gero calls the pair failures, and says he will deactivate them all. Android 17 reminds him that the remote is destroyed, but Gero says he can build another. Gero yells at Android 18 not to activate Android 16, but Android 17 punches Gero through the chest from behind. While Gero is confused, he pulls his hand out and decapitates Gero with a kick. The head rolls over to the Z Fighters and calls Android 17 and Android 18 pieces of junk. Android 17 runs over near the door and destroys Gero's head as the Z Fighters watch. Android 17 again tells Android 18 to activate Android 16, but a desperate Future Trunks says that he will not let there be any more androids, and fires a massive ki blast into the lab. When the smoke clears, Gero's lab is destroyed. However, Vegeta tells Future Trunks that the blast was pointless, as Android 17, Android 18, and the chamber containing Android 16 have survived. Android 17 suggests they open the chamber at once, as its pipes have been severed. As the Z Fighters watch in horror, Android 18 kicks open 16's chamber, activating him.

The Androids Walk Among Us,351 (DBZ 157),"The cover of the chapter features Android 16 standing.
 Having been activated, Android 16 steps out of his chamber and reveals his great height. As the Dragon Team watch, Krillin asks if they are in trouble now. Future Trunks says that he does not know, as he has never seen Android 16 before. Android 17 asks 16 what it feels like to be free for the first time in years, and tells him that Dr. Gero warned them not to activate him, saying he would destroy them all. Android 18 asks what Gero meant, but Android 16 does not respond. Android 17 then asks Android 16 whether he does not want to tell them or whether he is just the strong, silent type, but Android 16 still says nothing. Android 17 then asks if Android 16 was created to kill Goku, and Android 16 simply says yes. Android 17 says that he hates following Gero's programming, but that as machines they need a sense of purpose. The trio then rises into the air and flies away.
 Android 16 The Z Fighters are confused by the androids' sudden departure, although Krillin is thankful. Tien Shinhan asks where they are going, and Piccolo notes that it is the wrong direction to attack North City. Krillin then realizes that they are heading for Goku's house, as he was Gero's target, but Tien says that they rebelled against Dr. Gero. Vegeta asks who cares about all of that, but says that he was right there and they ignored him. He calls the androids fools for not thinking he was worth their time, and turns Super Saiyan. Trunks quickly jumps in front of him, telling him not to chase after them. He urges Vegeta to be patient, and wait until Goku has recovered. Vegeta tells Future Trunks that he has it wrong, and that Goku is the one he hates most. He says that he will defeat the androids himself, and then kill Goku after that. Trunks tells Vegeta that he will be going to his death, but Vegeta punches Trunks in the stomach and flies off. As he flies, Vegeta thinks that they do not need Goku since he is now a Super Saiyan, and that he should be considerably more powerful because he is the Saiyan prince.
 As the androids pass over a mountain road, Android 17 decides to land, and Android 18 and Android 16 follow suit. Android 18 asks why they have landed, and Android 17 says that there is no rush, and they might as well enjoy the trip. Android 18 asks if they are going to walk, but 17 says that a car will pass by eventually. 18 says that Android 17 is still part human, as he has the male love of pointless amusement. Android 17 asks Android 16 if he understands, since he was created from a human male too. Android 16 then reveals that he was created from nothing, making him fundamentally different from Android 17 and Android 18. Android 17 is surprised that Gero had the capability to make a true android, and wonders why he returned to cybernetics afterwards. As Android 17 thinks to himself, Vegeta lands nearby, and Android 17 notes that he looks different than before. Vegeta says that more than his looks have changed, and asks where the androids are headed. Android 18 reveals that they are going to Goku's house to kill him, but Vegeta says they will die here. Android 17 says that pride is the downfall of the weak, and an enraged Vegeta asks who will face him first. Android 18 orders Android 16 to fight Vegeta, but he refuses, so Android 18 says she will. Vegeta says that she is not a woman, but a machine.

 Super Saiyan Vegeta vs. Android 18 Android 18 has agreed to fight Vegeta, so the two prepare to face off. Android 18 gets the battle started quick by charging at Vegeta and unleashing a flurry of blows, but Vegeta manages to block them all. Android 17 says that Vegeta is not a bad fighter. One of Android 18's punches narrowly misses Vegeta, and he grabs her arm and throws her into a nearby rock wall. Vegeta charges after her and attacks, missing with a punch. 18 then blocks a knee from Vegeta, but he connects with a punch to the face, which sends her flying backwards. Android 17 says that Vegeta is much stronger than Dr. Gero's data indicate, and is impressed with his fighting abilities. Android 18 and Vegeta land on the road below, and Vegeta says that he can never tell when the androids are injured. He then says that he will just blow them to bits, so as never to see their smiles again.
 Vegeta fires an energy wave at Android 18 Just then, a truck drives up behind Android 18, and the driver tells Android 18 and Vegeta to get out of the road. Vegeta fires a Ki Blast at Android 18, who jumps into the air, causing the blast to hit the truck. The truck is destroyed, and Android 18 lands on the other side of Vegeta. He tells her that she is quicker than he thought, but she replies that he was not using full power. Vegeta says that if he did, the entire Earth would be gone, and 18 says that she is holding back as well. Vegeta tells her not to, if she wants to have any chance to defeat him. 18 agrees not to, then charges at Vegeta, headbutting him in the face. Vegeta stumbles backwards, then charges at Android 18 and punches her in the stomach. However, she is unaffected, and knees Vegeta in the chest before knocking him into the nearby rock wall. Future Trunks. Piccolo, Tien Shinhan, and Krillin then land, and Trunks asks Vegeta if he is okay. Vegeta climbs out of the hole created by his impact and calls the four of them pests, then asks if they think they stand a chance.

 Android 18 is still standing despite Vegeta's attack With the Dragon Team having come to the support of Vegeta, Android 17 says that Android 18 cannot take them all on herself, and that he will have to step in. He asks Android 16 if he will help, but Android 16 says he will not. Android 17 calls him a bum and wonders why he was created, which Android 16 says is to kill Goku. Android 17 begins to walk towards the Z Fighters, and Future Trunks tells Vegeta that they must run, and that his pride is no good if he dies. Android 18 mockingly tells him he can leave, but Vegeta says that he is about to finish her off, and that he would rather die before join forces with the Z Fighters. Android 17 claps at this speech and says that Vegeta truly is a Saiyan prince, but Vegeta spits and says he does not need a puppet's praise.
 Android 17 then tells the other Z Fighters to respect the code of the warrior and not interfere between Android 18 and Vegeta. He promises to deal with anyone who does. The fight resumes with Android 18 charging towards Vegeta and punching him in the face, sending him flying. 18 pursues, but Vegeta kicks off a nearby rock wall and hits Android 18, sending her flying backwards into another one. Vegeta then fires a Big Bang Attack, and as Android 18 begins to emerge from the rubble, she can't dodge it.
 Android 18 breaks Vegeta's arm Vegeta begins to fly towards the explosion, and when the smoke clears, Android 18 is still standing. She is damaged and her clothes are torn. Vegeta lands in front of her and says that this is making him mad. Android 18 removes off her jacket, smiles with a quite surprise expression and says that she did not think any organic being could fight like Vegeta, and asks if Goku is even stronger.
  
Vegeta angrily replies he is not, and Android 18 smiles again and answers that she does not have to worry about either of them. This angers Vegeta, who attacks Android 18 with a kick. She blocks it, and Vegeta attacks her with a lot of hits, and the android backs.
  
Tien Shinhan cheers Vegeta, while the rest of the Z Fighters watch silently, impressed. Android 17 seems amused by the battle. Future Trunks is surprised at his father's strength, noting that he can hold his own against Android 18, who is stronger than Android 18 in future. However, Piccolo does not share Future Trunks's optimism, and says that Vegeta will be killed, which surprises Future Trunks and Krillin. Piccolo says that Vegeta is losing stamina, while 18 loses low power. Just then, Android 18 manages to sweep Vegeta's legs, and punches him in the face as he attempts to get up. She follows this up with a kick which hits Vegeta's left arm, breaking it. Seeing this, Future Trunks is enraged, and turns Super Saiyan while flying towards the battle.

The Androids at Ease,354 (DBZ 160),"The cover of this chapter shows Android 17, Android 16, and Android 18 with Goku in the background. This cover art is also featured in Daizenshuu 1.
 Android 17 chokes Tien Shinhan Enraged at seeing his father injured, Future Trunks flies towards the battle. Piccolo angrily calls him an idiot, and Android 17 chases after him, as he had promised earlier. Seeing this, Piccolo and Tien Shinhan fly towards the battle as well. Android 18 notices Future Trunks approaching, and blocks his sword strike. Future Trunks is then hit in the back of the head by Android 17, and collapses on the ground. Krillin, watching the battle from up on the road, is stunned that a Super Saiyan was defeated in one shot. Android 17 senses Piccolo coming towards him and kicks the Namekian in midair, then quickly flies to Tien and puts him in a headlock.
 Android 17 delivers a heavy blow to Piccolo Having gotten back up, Vegeta attempts to fly towards Android 17 and Tien, but Android 18 grabs his foot. As Android 17 chokes Tien, Future Trunks gets up and runs towards Android 18, who swings Vegeta into Future Trunks, sending them both to the ground. Piccolo, getting up, is horrified to see this, and then notices Android 17 still choking Tien. He dashes up towards Android 17, who lets Tien fall. Android 17 dodges Piccolo's punch, then delivers a strong blow to his chest. Still having not moved, Krillin watches in horror as Android 17 lets Piccolo fall. Vegeta manages to get up and fly into the air, and fires a Ki Blast at Android 18 with his good arm. However, Android 18 dodges the blast and flies over to Vegeta. She punches him in the face, sending him to the ground again. Vegeta then tries to get back up, only to be kicked by Android 18 in the stomach. He falls to the ground. Android 18 then says that just to be sure he does not try that again she should disable his other arm. She puts the heel of her boot on his good arm and pushes down, making it break. Vegeta yells in pain. He then loses consciousness and reverts to his base form.
 Android 18 kicks Vegeta in the stomach Android 17 notes that Vegeta's hair has changed back and his glow is gone, and says that the transformation was very weird. Android 18 notes that the 'other guy' (meaning Future Trunks) was the same way, and Android 17 wonders who he was, as they have no data on him. He and Android 18 then fly back up to the road and land near Krillin, frightening him. Android 17 tells him that the others are still alive, and that he should feed them some Senzu Beans right away. He then tells a speechless Krillin that they will fight the Z Fighters whenever they feel up to it.
 Android 18 swings Vegeta into Future Trunks Android 17 then turns to leave, and Android 18 asks if he will inquire about Goku's location. Android 17 says that it will be more fun to find it on their own, and says that maybe even Goku will look for them. The pair then meet up with Android 16, who is still nearby, looking off into the distance. Android 17 asks what he is looking at, and Android 16 simply says that the birds flew away because they were too noisy. Android 17 seems confused by this, and Android 18 suggests they fly to someplace where more cars will pass by. Krillin watches all of this, still stunned.
"
Retreat and Regroup,355 (DBZ 161),"The cover features Vegeta, Krillin, Future Trunks, and Piccolo on the destroyed Mountain Road.
 The conclusion of the android fight As the Dragon Team (with the exception of Krillin) lie in the rubble below, the androids decide to go to the nearest town. As they are about to leave, Krillin rushes over to them, telling them to wait. Android 17 asks what he wants, and Krillin asks if they just want to kill Goku, or take over the world. 17 says that for now they are just going to kill Goku, and will decide what to do next afterwards. Krillin asks why they want to kill Goku, since it was Dr. Gero who hated him, and he is now dead. 17 replies that Goku is the strongest being on Earth and that this is just a game, which is why he did not ask Krillin where Goku is. Krillin asks if they would leave Goku alone if he begged them, but Android 16 replies that they would not, they were created to kill Goku. 17 agrees, and tells Krillin to go give his friends some Senzu Beans. Android 18 then kisses Krillin on the cheek, and the androids fly off.
 Android 18 kisses Krillin on the cheek Krillin is momentarily stunned by this, but quickly regains his composure and feeds Piccolo, Tien, Future Trunks, and Vegeta Senzu Beans. Piccolo is surprised to hear that the androids knew about Senzu Beans, and Tien wonders why the androids did not finish them off. Piccolo says that the androids did not think they were worth killing, and admits that they are much stronger than he imagined. Vegeta is visibly upset at what has occurred, and flies off without warning. Piccolo tells the others not to follow him, as he is upset due to the blow to his pride. Krillin apologizes for not helping in the fight, but Piccolo says that he would not have made a difference. Tien says that even with Goku they cannot win, as he is not much more powerful than Trunks. Trunks reveals that the androids in this timeline are stronger than the ones in his own. Piccolo tells the others to go to Goku's House and move him elsewhere. Krillin asks what Piccolo will do, and says that he looks like he has a plan. He urges the Namekian to tell them, as they are his friends. Piccolo angrily responds that he is not friends with them, and that he is still a demon who is using them to take over the world. He then flies off unexpectedly.
 Tien is surprised that Piccolo is still plotting to take over the world, but Krillin believes this is a bluff, and that Piccolo is going to figure out his trump card. Tien asks what Krillin means, and Krillin points out that Piccolo has flown off in the direction of the Lookout. Krillin suggests that Piccolo is going to fuse with Kami, which shows how scared of the androids he really is, as Piccolo hates Kami. Tien notes that the Dragon Balls will disappear, but Krillin says that they will anyway if Piccolo or Kami die. Trunks asks what Vegeta will do, and almost calls him 'Dad,' leading Krillin to reveal that all of them except Vegeta know his true identity. Tien says that Vegeta will most likely come up with some new devastating attack to combat the androids. Vegeta is then shown flying at high speed, swearing to make the androids regret that they let him live. As they fly to Goku's house, Krillin asks Trunks how long it will take Goku to recover, and Trunks says it may be as little as ten days. Krillin believes they can stay out of sight for that long.
 At Goku's house, Chi-Chi searches frantically for the Heart Medicine before finally finding it. Yamcha gives Goku the medicine, and he quickly appears to improve a bit. Yamcha says they should both take the medicine as well, as the Heart Virus is allegedly contagious. Chi-Chi then asks where Gohan is, and Yamcha nervously replies that he must be out playing somewhere. Meanwhile, Piccolo reaches Korin Tower and immediately flies upwards as Korin watches. Kami and Mr. Popo sense Piccolo's ki as well, and Piccolo, upon arriving, materializes a new cape and turban and then lands.
"
Kami's Conditions,356 (DBZ 162),"
 
 
 The cover of the chapter features Kami and Piccolo facing each other on The Lookout.
 Mr. Popo, Kami, and Piccolo on Kami's Lookout Having just landed on The Lookout, Piccolo angrily stares at Kami, who does the same to him as Mr. Popo watches nervously. Piccolo says that Kami can probably guess why he came, and Kami says that his thoughts are easy to guess. Kami says that he never believed the day would come when they would be one again, and Piccolo tells him that this will not be an equal union. He says that this is only to make him stronger, and that Kami's only reason for existence now is the Dragon Balls. Mr. Popo begins to intercede, but Kami stops him, saying that Piccolo is correct, and noting that his power is next to nothing against the androids. He says that even a fully-recovered Goku will likely not prevail. Kami agrees to fuse with Piccolo, but only after they wait for a while. Piccolo is enraged, and asks why. Kami responds that he wants to see if the androids are harmful to Earth. When Piccolo cites the recent battle as evidence, Kami says that the Dragon Team started it. Piccolo reminds him that the androids devastated Earth in Future Trunks' timeline, but Kami says these androids are different. Piccolo calls Kami a coward, and says he will wait at the Lookout until Kami changes his mind.
 Androids 16, 17 and 18 empty and steal a truck Meanwhile, in the Northern Mountains, the androids spot a Lucky Foods van driving along the road. When the van stops so the Lucky Foods workers can have some coffee, the androids land and check it out. The workers notice them, but are frightened when Android 16 lifts the van and dumps out its cargo. The androids then drive off, and Android 17 plans to head to Goku's House. Android 18 says she wants new clothes first, and 17 agrees to take care of that first. As Krillin, Tien Shinhan, and Future Trunks fly to Goku's house, Tien says that he will go check in with Chiaotzu instead, but will return before things get ugly. Krillin tells him they will move Goku to Kame House. Future Trunks wonders why history has changed so much, but Krillin has no ideas. The pair soon reach Goku's house and knock on the door. Krillin, still thinking of Android 18, asks Future Trunks if the androids are really bad guys, but Future Trunks tells Krillin not to hope for the absurd.
 Chi-Chi answers the door, and wonders who Future Trunks is. Yamcha recognizes him, and Krillin asks how Goku is. Yamcha tells him that he has given Goku the medicine, and Krillin says that they all must move to Kame House because the androids are coming. Yamcha is surprised that the new androids are even more powerful than Nos. 19 and 20. The group carries Goku into a Capsule plane and decides to wait for Gohan. Gohan soon arrives and asks what is going on, and Krillin promises to tell him on the plane.
"
A Discovery,357 (DBZ 163),"The cover features the Dragon Team in a Capsule 576 airplane driven by Yamcha, with the sick Goku on board.
 On the airplane to Kame House, Krillin relates to Yamcha, Gohan, and Chi-Chi how powerful the new androids are, saying that killing Goku is a game to them. Yamcha asks what they should do, and Krillin admits he has no idea. Future Trunks suggests that he go even farther back in time using his Time Machine and destroy the androids before they are activated, since they now know where Dr. Gero's Lab was. Yamcha thinks this is a good plan, but Krillin asks if he can get back to the future after going further into the past, as the Time Machine takes a long time to charge up. Gohan asks if the current androids would simply disappear, and Future Trunks realizes that only the timeline he would travel to would be affected. Krillin is confused, and Future Trunks explains that each trip to the past creates new futures, using their situation as an example. Yamcha and Krillin then ask what the point of Future Trunks' trip to their timeline was, and Future Trunks says that he was hoping to find the androids' weakness or bring Goku to his timeline. He notes that this timeline is different, and Gohan asks why. Future Trunks says he does not know, but Chi-Chi says not to worry, as his trip has saved Goku's life. The others agree that things will turn out for the best.
 Vegeta's anger Meanwhile, Vegeta, still incensed over losing to Android 18, is training alone in the mountains. He turns Super Saiyan and destroys the nearby rock formations with just his power. He says that a Super Saiyan is supposed to be invincible, and wonders how he was defeated, as he should be the strongest in the universe. He vows to surpass the androids, and then to defeat Goku. Meanwhile, the androids are still driving in the Lucky Foods van. 18 asks Android 17 if he knows where Goku's House is, and 17 says they will find something eventually. Android 16 then chimes in with the house's coordinates, and says they can be there in a few minutes if they fly. 18 agrees with flying there, but 17 says that small things in life are what make it fun.
 Back on the Capsule airplane, Krillin is chosen to call Bulma and tell her what has happened. Krillin complains, telling Future Trunks that his mother always bites people's heads off, and Future Trunks says that she is the same in the future. Krillin then calls Bulma, who immediately yells at him for not having called sooner. Bulma asks where they are and if Future Trunks is there. Krillin replies that he is, and Bulma tells him to put Future Trunks on. Bulma relates to Future Trunks how a farmer found a strange Capsule Corporation vehicle out in the wilderness, and asked for the company's help to operate it. Bulma says that they did not recognize the man's description, so they asked for a photo, and that the vehicle is in fact Future Trunks' Time Machine, only wrecked. Future Trunks is stunned, saying that he has his Time Machine with him in capsule form. Bulma tells Future Trunks that the Time Machine in the photo is covered with moss and looks old, and asks how many she made in the future. Future Trunks says that she was barely able to make one, and Bulma decides to fax Trunks the picture. She does so, the picture shows Future Trunks' Time Machine damaged and covered in moss, which stuns Future Trunks.
"
The Time Machine,358 (DBZ 164),"The cover of this chapter features Future Trunks with an old Time Machine in the background.
 Future Trunks holds a picture of an old Time Machine Looking at the photo faxed by Bulma, Future Trunks says that the machine show is his Time Machine, which leaves the others stunned. Krillin asks Bulma for the machine's exact location, and Bulma tells him the coordinates. Future Trunks says that he is going, as he must see the machine with his own eyes. Bulma agrees to meet him there, as it is close to Capsule Corporation. Yamcha asks if Future Trunks is sure that there is only one Time Machine, and Future Trunks replies that he is. Gohan offers to accompany Future Trunks, who gladly says that he can. Chi-Chi is upset, but Gohan tells her they are not going anywhere dangerous. At Capsule Corporation, Bulma tells her mother, to watch Trunks, as she is going to see her baby all grown up. This remark shocks Bikini, causing her to open her eyes.
 Future Trunks, Gohan and Bulma investigate a strange eggshell they found inside the Time Machine As they fly to meet Bulma, Gohan asks Future Trunks how badly his world has been devastated. Future Trunks tells him that the population is in the tens of thousands, West City has been destroyed, and live in underground shelters. Gohan says he hopes Future Trunks finds their weakness, and Future Trunks begins to think out loud about what it might be. He concludes that Dr. Gero must have had some sort of emergency off switch to control the androids due to their power, or else he would not have activated them again. Gohan says that this must be the case, and Future Trunks says the he hopes so. They then arrive at the specified location, and quickly find the Time Machine. Bulma then arrives, and Future Trunks brings out his Time Machine to show her. Future Trunks tells her that she only made one Time Machine in the future, and says that his is his Time Machine. He then uncovers a message saying 'HOPE!' on the second Time Machine, which he says he wrote the day he left. Trunks and Gohan fly up to the top of the machine, and Gohan notices that the cockpit window has been melted through from the inside.
 Seeing this, Future Trunks decides to open the window, and does so. He notices two halves of something inside, which Bulma says look like an egg. Gohan wonders if what was in the egg made the hole in the window. Noticing that the Time Machine still has a bit of power, Future Trunks turns it on and discovers that it came from Age 788, three years after he left. He also finds out that the machine has been there for four years, and wonders if this is why history has changed so much. Watching from the Lookout, Kami is visibly agitated. Piccolo mocks him for peeping on the world below, saying he will lose the ability once they fuse. Kami wonders out loud what came from the Time Machine, and says there is a creature on Earth more powerful than the androids. Piccolo asks what he is babbling about, and Kami says the time has come to fuse, and that he cannot see any hope for the coming crisis.
"
Kami-sama's Vision,359 (DBZ 165),"The cover of the chapter features the scared face of Kami.
 Bulma, Future Trunks, and Gohan investigate a mysterious husk Future Trunks says that they cannot leave the second Time Machine where it is, so he puts it into capsule form, then does the same with his. Bulma takes the two eggshells that they found in the Time Machine, and Gohan informs her that they are heading to Kame House. Bulma asks why, and Gohan tells her that the androids are coming after Goku, who is still recovering. Bulma asks why they cannot just beat them up, but Future Trunks tells her that the androids defeated them. She asks if Vegeta went to Kame House as well, but Future Trunks says that he went off on his own. Gohan then notices something, and goes over to look at it, quickly calling Bulma and Future Trunks to come as well. When they arrive, they see what appears to be a giant husk left behind by a molting insect. Bulma asks if there is a cicada that size, Future Trunks says that there is no cicada large enough for that. He then suggests that the insect is what came out of the egg in the Time Machine, and notices that the husk is still gooey, meaning that the insect molted recently.
 Android 18 goes shopping Bulma asks if they are getting a bad feeling about this, and Gohan and Future Trunks indicate that they are. They decide to leave, and Bulma tells Future Trunks to come visit if he has the time. As he flies to Kame House, Future Trunks thinks that none of this makes sense. Meanwhile, the androids have stopped in a rural town so that Android 18 can buy some clothes. She chooses a cowgirl outfit, which she says looks hideous but is the best she can expect from a backwater place. She leaves without paying, and the androids drive off as the store owner bangs on their van. He then calls the police, and soon a police car begin to pursue the androids' van. Android 18 flies out and punches the front of the car, causing it to go off the road into a ditch.
 Androids 18 and 17 joyriding On the Lookout, Kami suddenly becomes agitated and asks what that thing is. Piccolo asks what's going on, and if this is related to the Time Machine that Kami mentioned earlier. At the same time, as she flies back home, Bulma hears a news report saying that all contact has been lost with Gingertown. The report continues on to say that an investigative team was sent in, and all of the residents appear to have vanished for unknown reasons. Bulma nervously realizes that Gingertown is very close to where they found the second Time Machine.
"
Kami-sama and the Demon King Become One,360 (DBZ 166),"The cover of the chapter features Piccolo and Kami standing back to back on The Lookout.
 Kami fuses with Piccolo Alarmed by the news broadcast she is seeing, Bulma calls Kame House from her airplane. Krillin answers and tells her that Gohan and Future Trunks have not returned, and Bulma instructs him to turn their television to channel 872. Krillin, Yamcha, and Master Roshi do so, and they see a report telling them that the clothes of the people of Gingertown have been found abandoned. After repeating the news that the population of Gingertown has vanished, the report goes on to say that the residents seemed to have been fighting something. Krillin believes the androids have attacked, but Bulma disagrees, saying that Gohan and Future Trunks can tell him what they saw when they return. The pair return soon after, and watch the news broadcast as police shoot at something in the background. The police soon stop shooting, and the cameraman himself appears scared and screams for help before the signal is cut off.
 Up on The Lookout, Piccolo asks what Kami is seeing down on Earth. Kami replies that there is no need to explain, as Piccolo will know once they become one. Piccolo and Mr. Popo are surprised by this, with Piccolo being pleased that Kami made up his mind so quickly. Piccolo demands to be the dominant mind, to which Kami agrees, saying that he will simply give Piccolo power and knowledge. Piccolo touches Kami on the chest, and Kami says that the Earth now needs a great warrior rather than a god. Piccolo and Kami then fuse. Mr. Popo, calling the newly formed Namekian Kami, tells him not to die. The fused Namekian says that he is no longer Piccolo or Kami, but is a Namekian who has forgotten his name. He then waves and says he must go before flying away.
 Back at Kame House, Future Trunks believes that whatever hatched from the egg they found is causing the problems in Gingertown. Although Yamcha and Krillin urge him not to, he decides to go investigate. Gohan says that he will go as well, and Chi-Chi loudly objects. Future Trunks tells the trio to stay and protect Goku from the androids, and that he can handle himself. Meanwhile, Piccolo has flown to Gingertown and quickly spots the creature (whose feet are visible). He calls the thing a freak of nature.
"
Cell,361 (DBZ 167),"The cover of the chapter features Cell in his Imperfect Form.
 Cell's first appearance Piccolo calls Cell a freak of nature, but Cell's ki shocks him. The Richest man in Gingertown, being held by Cell, begs Piccolo for help, offering him whatever he wants. Piccolo tells Cell to let the man go, and that a life is a life, even a worthless one like that man's. Cell seemingly complies by dropping the man, who starts to crawl towards Piccolo. Cell, however, stabs the man in the back with his tail and absorbs him, shocking Piccolo. Cell then looks at Piccolo and tells him that he is next, calling him by name. Piccolo, stunned, asks how Cell knows his name and who he is. Cell then powers up, surprising Piccolo again, and tells Piccolo that he is his brother.
 Piccolo faces Cell and powers up At Kame House, Future Trunks, Gohan, Yamcha, and Krillin feel Cell's ki and are shocked. As they head outside, Krillin says that he has felt this ki before. Gohan says the he feels Frieza and King Cold, while Future Trunks says the he feels Goku, Piccolo, and even his father. Yamcha says that he feels them as well, but notes that this is impossible, as Frieza and King Cold were killed. Gohan flies to the upper window and confirms that Goku is still in bed. Future Trunks says that the ki is coming from the direction of Gingertown, and that he will go and investigate. Elsewhere on Earth, Vegeta feels Cell's ki, as do Tien Shinhan and Chiaotzu. All three wonder what is going on.
 In Ginger Town, Piccolo again asks Cell who he is, demanding to be told everything. Cell asks why Piccolo would need to know that while inside of his stomach. Piccolo says that he will kill Cell without knowing, but Cell scoffs at this. Piccolo asks what Cell knows about him, and powers up. He then tells Cell that he unfortunately has the wrong man, which confuses Cell.
"
Ginger Town Showdown,362 (DBZ 168),"Original colored version of the cover image, made for the anime staff The cover features Imperfect Cell in his Imperfect, exoskeleton, and egg forms. This image was colored by Akira Toriyama for Toei Animation to have Cell's colors for his appearance in the Dragon Ball Z anime.
 Cell asks if Piccolo is saying that he is not Piccolo, and Piccolo tells him that he is catching on. As he flies towards Gingertown, Future Trunks senses another powerful ki, but does not know whose it is. Krillin quickly recognizes it as Piccolo's, and says that he must have merged. Future Trunks is surprised, and asks if Krillin means merging with Kami. Krillin says yes, and notes that Piccolo was already powerful beforehand. Future Trunks is surprised at the difference made by the fusion. In Gingertown, Piccolo says that it is convenient that Cell killed all of the residents already, as now he does not have to hold back. He then hits Cell with a massive Ki Blast.
 Piccolo fires an Explosive Demon Wave at Cell Still en route, Future Trunks and Krillin feel the massive blast. Future Trunks wonders what happened, and Krillin notes that the blast is visible from where they are. Future Trunks concludes that the battle must have begun. When the smoke clears, Cell is nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the androids are driving when Android 17 suddenly stops. He and Android 18 get out, and Android 17 asks if she felt a shudder in the air. Android 18 says that she did, and Android 16 says that it came from a suburb of West City. He then says that two powerful ki are fighting. Android 17 says that he never told them he was equipped with sensors, but Android 16 replies that he never asked. Android 17 asks who is fighting, but Android 16 says neither are in his databanks, although one of them rivals Android 17 in power. Android 17 says that his sensors are malfunctioning, as no one rivals him in power. The androids then decide to continue onwards.
 Cell prepares a Kamehameha Back at Ginger Town, Cell manages to get up, and Piccolo charges at him. Cell swipes at Piccolo and misses, and Piccolo kicks him in the back. Cell lands and regains his composure, but Piccolo quickly kicks him into the air again. When Cell lands, Piccolo asks if that is all he has got. Cell says that Piccolo is not a bad fighter, but that he is not yet in his Perfect form. Piccolo asks if that is why he is attacking people, and Cell confirms that he is extracting their lives for energy. Piccolo then angrily demands to know who sent him in the time machine, and Cell reveals that he sent himself, after reverting to his egg form due to the machine's small size. Cell says that he is surprised Piccolo knows about the time machine, but says that he will not know his next move. Cell then begins to do a Kamehameha, shocking Piccolo when he recognizes the stance.
"
A Farewell to Arms,363 (DBZ 169),"The cover features Imperfect Cell, Android 17, Android 18, with the faces of Cell's coponents in bubbles: Vegeta, Piccolo, Goku, Mecha Frieza, and King Cold in circles.
 Cell fires his Kamehameha at Piccolo As the Creature prepares to fire a Kamehameha, Piccolo is shocked, wondering how it knows the move. The Creature unleashes his blast, and Piccolo is surprised to see that it is indeed a Kamehameha. He manages to dodge, leaping into the air. The monster, however, ambushes Piccolo and grabs him from behind, pinning his arms and legs. It says that he has him now, and stabs Piccolo in the arm with his tail. He manages to suck energy from Piccolo's arm before the Namekian headbutts him and escapes. Piccolo's right arm, however, is now withered and useless. The Creature and Piccolo land, and It tells Piccolo that he cannot defeat him with only one arm.
 Cell absorbs the energy from Piccolo's arm Piccolo agrees, saying that he cannot compete with it in his current state, and that It has won. The Creature praises Piccolo's sensibility, and says that his initial evolution will be nearly complete after he absorbs Piccolo's life force. Piccolo asks the Creature to tell him how he has Goku and Frieza's kis and knows the Kamehameha. It decides to grant what he considers a meaningless last wish, and reveals his name to be Cell and the fact that he is an artificial life form. He says that he was created by Dr. Gero's computer, after the doctor experimented with combining cells from great fighters. He reveals that although Gero abandoned the experiment, the computer never gave up, and harvested cells from Goku, Piccolo, and Vegeta three years before for the project. Piccolo says that Cell's Kamehameha was weak because the cells used from Goku were three years old. Cell continues on, noting that samples were taken from Frieza and King Cold when they came to Earth, but that cells from Future Trunks were not used because the computer had enough Saiyan samples. This does, however, explain why Cell's ki is identical to Goku and the others.
 The remote tracking device is spotted by Piccolo Piccolo asks how the cells were harvested, and Cell tells him about the small spy robots that followed their every move and scraped their cells. He points out the presence of one right there, and Piccolo angrily destroys it. Cell says that it is too late, and that the research has been done. Piccolo tells him that Dr. Gero's Lab was destroyed, but Cell says that the computer was in the basement. Piccolo asks why it took Cell three years to come back in time, and Cell explains that he needed three years to mature from his egg form. Piccolo then asks why Cell came back in the first place, and Cell explains that he needs to absorb Android 17 and Android 18 to reach his perfect form, but somehow Future Trunks had defeated them in his time. He says that he stole Future Trunks' Time Machine and came back to the past, to a time that Future Trunks had already programmed in. All Cell had to do was push a button. Piccolo, understanding everything so far, theorizes that the Trunks from Cell's timeline figured out a way to destroy the Androids, and intended to travel back again to tell them how to destroy them. Cell then says that when he is complete, he will have unimaginable powers, and Piccolo asks why he wants so much power. Cell replies that he was created to be the most powerful being in the cosmos. Piccolo then thanks Cell for answering his questions, and rips off his withered arm. He quickly regenerates a new one, stunning Cell. Cell asks if the questions were a trick just to keep him talking, and Piccolo says that Cell should have known about his regeneration, since he has Piccolo's cells.
"
Cell Laughs Last,364 (DBZ 170),"The cover features Future Trunks, Krillin, Vegeta and Tien Shinhan listening to Piccolo telling about Cell.
 Cell uses the Solar Flare on the Z Fighters and then escapes Cell, the creature who had previously before acquired a Time Machine to head back into the past, is now confronted by the powerful fusion of Kami and Piccolo, who Cell still believes is Piccolo, due to his appearance not changing at all. Earlier on, Cell had absorbed the energy from the Nameless Namekian's arm, draining it completely dry. Piccolo however, due to clever distraction, manages to make the android talk long enough to gather plenty of information, and enough time for Piccolo to regenerate his arm so he can fight back. Piccolo states, even though Cell has new found energy from Piccolo's arm, increasing his strength, Piccolo is still beyond Cell's capabilities, and Piccolo prepares to finish this fight quickly. Cell, admiring Piccolo's intellect and tactics, praises the Namekian, surprised himself he had fallen for Piccolo's folly. Piccolo however, states this tactic came from the mind of Kami. From this information, Cell comes to the conclusion that Kami and Piccolo have become one once again, explaining Piccolo's power, which has kept him slightly above Cell's abilities. Cell however, also concludes that due to this fusion, the Dragon Balls have now become stone and unusable, thus, nobody can be revived from the dead, a tactic which works well in Cell's favor. Just at this point in time, Krillin and Future Trunks arrive on the scene, flying at high speeds. They notice the monster, and are left in complete awe and shock at its appearance, as Future Trunks remembers the egg he, his mother Bulma, and Kuririn had found earlier, which Cell must have developed and hatched from. Cell, remembering he had killed Trunks in his timeline, estimates that Trunks must have used the time machine too, and gone back in time to prevent Android 17 and Android 18 from causing their extreme global destruction. As Future Trunks and Kuririn descend to the ground, the manage to get a better look at the creatures face, something which horrifies Kuririn. Kuririn asks Piccolo if this creature was the one who had previously slaughtered everyone in Ginger Town, to which Piccolo confirms, stating the creature must be destroyed at all costs, which should be an easy task due his new powers from the fusion. Kuririn asks why can he feel Goku's familiar ki coming from the monster, something Piccolo says he will explain later, after they have successfully destroyed the creature.
 Piccolo angry that Cell got away Realizing now he will not survive if he attacks directly, Cell decides to retreat and absorb more victims, and then finally absorb Androids 17 and 18. Piccolo calls Cell's idea a joke, remembering the less than average Kamehameha Cell had fired before, something Piccolo states was a sign of Cell's limit of power, and thus, has no chance of escaping from Piccolo's much increased speed. Kuririn also becomes shocked that the creature can use the legendary Kamehameha wave. Cell replies to Kuririn by stating that not only can he use the Kamehameha, he could also use the Spirit Bomb if he truly felt like it. Shocked that Cell knows his name, Kuririn thinks that Goku will be even more shocked than he is when he is informed of this. Learning that Goku is still alive, Cell now knows that this timeline is drastically different than the timeline he was created in, stating many things must have changed over the course of these few months. Cell, now with a full plan of escape, shouts that not only we he absorb Androids 17 and 18 and become the perfect creation in the entire course of history, but will also bring terror to the universe, stating that Piccolo must get stronger if he wants any chance of stopping him. Cell, now done with his threat, raises his hands and prepares a Solar Flare, and blinds his foes with a blast of bright light, making his escape.
 Vegeta amazed by Piccolo's power Angered by Cell's quite easy escape, Piccolo chases after the monster, however, Cell has managed to lower his ki enough so that he in untraceable. As Cell runs through a woodland area, he chuckles at his own getaway, admiring his opponents stupidity. Cell now states he will absorb hundreds of more humans to increase his power higher than Piccolos and the Androids, and then, he will have easy access to absorbing them. Cell's only fear was the Shut Down Remote that the humans could have used to disable the androids, and then destroy them. However, to Cell's advantage, the device no longer exists. Cell remembers another city nearby, and prepares to have his next meal. Cell however, notices Vegeta flying nearby, and makes sure to hide behind a tall tree trunk. Surprised Vegeta has not suffered his fate to the hands of the androids yet, Cell decides to pick up the pace, and make sure he absorbs more civilians as quickly as possible. Vegeta, who had noticed the rising ki when Piccolo and Cell were in combat, decided to check out the situation, however, now can only feel Piccolo's ki, due to Cell lowering his. As Piccolo powers up in anger of Cell's lucky slip past Piccolo's fingers, Vegeta, Future Trunks, and Kuririn all notice Piccolo's amazing power, which has surpassed everyone else.
 Cell looks over a city As Vegeta descends to Piccolo, Future Trunks, and Kuririn's location, Vegeta demands an answer to the powers he felt, and what has happened. Piccolo offers to explain everyone once Tien Shinhan arrives, who is currently heading to their location. Thinking quietly, Piccolo understands that his new found powers are still inferior to the abilities of the three Androids. As Tien Shinhan lands, Piccolo then explains everything he knows about the situation, and about Cell himself. Piccolo explains that Cell is a collection of all the Dragon Team's ki, and thus, has their abilities. Piccolo also explains that Cell came from a time machine in order to absorb the Android 17 and Android 18 to achieve a ""perfect form"", and will become the ultimate being in existence. This news brings unwelcome feelings to Vegeta and Tien Shinhan, especially Vegeta, utterly angry over this ""thing"" having his cells inside its body. Meanwhile, Cell noticed the city he remembered earlier, and now prepares his decent upon the city, preparing to absorb each and every human he comes across without mercy. Back with the Z Fighters, Piccolo concludes the story, and explains that the Androids need to be destroyed before Cell can lay his hands on them. Vegeta, still amazed that these machines can surpass a Super Saiyan in power, which was enough to destroy the formally strongest opponent in the galaxy Frieza. As Vegeta tries to understand how so many beings can be this strong, he just hopes the still sick Goku agrees with him, who is still lying in his bed, in risk of death due to the fatal Heart Virus. Piccolo and the others now prepare a plan, and make it their duty to end the android threat once and for all.

Son Goku Awakens,365 (DBZ 171),"The cover of the chapter features the starting scene of the chapter: the Dragon Team discussing the situation.
 Future Trunks and Krillin inside the basement of Dr. Gero's laboratory With Cell having escaped, Krillin says that the group will have to go find him. Future Trunks wonders if they can, noting that Cell will most likely attack innocent people with his ki suppressed. Tien Shinhan says they must stop Cell's fusions with Android 17 and Android 18. Vegeta dismissively suggests they let Cell fuse with the androids, as it will leave fewer opponents to take out, and that he can kill them. Piccolo reminds him that he was powerless against the androids. Angered, Vegeta declares that he will transcend the Super Saiyan state, and that Goku will do the same. He then flies off, leaving Piccolo wondering if such a thing is possible. Krillin asks Future Trunks if he is correct in believing that traveling to the past and destroying the androids would change nothing in their timeline. Future Trunks confirms this, but says that they should destroy Dr. Gero's Lab in this timeline to prevent another Cell from appearing. Piccolo instructs the pair to do that while he and Tien search for Cell.
 Future Trunks and Krillin destroying Dr. Gero's secret laboratory Krillin and Future Trunks quickly reach the lab's location, and after some brief searching find a hole down to the lab's basement. They discover Dr. Gero's Supercomputer along with Present Cell in his larval form. Just as Krillin is about to destroy the basement, Future Trunks finds blueprints for Androids 17 and 18. He pockets the blueprints to take to his mother, and the pair destroy the rest of the laboratory. As they fly away, Future Trunks asks Krillin to take the blueprints to Bulma, saying that he is going to train with Vegeta. Krillin says that Vegeta will most likely refuse. Future Trunks says he does not want to train with a monster like Vegeta, but that he will realize that training together is more efficient.
 Meanwhile, Tien senses a slight disturbance in ki, and he and Piccolo follow it to a nearby town. They find a deserted city with people's clothes left behind, and realize that Cell has already struck. Cell, hiding on the roof of a nearby building, thinks that their chase is futile.
 Goku awakes healthy again At Capsule Corporation, Bulma and Dr. Brief analyze the blueprints brought by Krillin. Bulma states that the androids are based on humans and enhanced almost entirely by bio-organic components, which is why Cell believes it can fuse with them. Bulma says that the few cybernetic parts may be the key to finding their weakness, and the pair promise to work as quickly as possible. Three days pass uneventfully before Cell strikes again in the South District. Hearing of the attack from the news, Yamcha, Gohan, Krillin, Tien, and Piccolo decide to approach by plane so as not to raise their ki. At Kame House, Chi-Chi goes upstairs to check on Goku, but finds him already awake and getting dressed for battle. Master Roshi arrives, and the pair try and convince Goku not to rush back to fighting. Goku says that he heard everyone talking in his dreams, and that he knows what is going on. Chi-Chi admonishes him not to fight, and Goku says that he will not. He then claims that he is conserving his strength to transcend the Super Saiyan state.
"
The Super Saiyans' Training,366 (DBZ 172),"The cover features the starting scene of the chapter: Goku, Chi-Chi and Master Roshi at Kame House, discussing the situation.
 The Androids arrive at Goku's house Master Roshi asks Goku if transcending the Super Saiyan state is even possible, and Goku replies that he does not know. He says that he will attempt to by training for one year, leading Master Roshi to ask if they have a year. Goku says that he knows a place where he can get a year's worth of training in one day, and asks Chi-Chi if he can bring Gohan. She says that her initial reaction would be an emphatic no, but that trying to stop Goku is pointless. After having Goku agree to make Gohan as strong as possible and get a job after the conflict is over, Chi-Chi lets Goku go. He teleports away to the airplane carrying the other Z Fighters. The group is overjoyed to see him, but Goku tells them that he cannot beat the androids or Cell the way that he is now. He then says that he will train with Gohan for a year in one day, and Piccolo realizes that he is referencing the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.
 Future Trunks and Vegeta enter the Hyperbolic Time Chamber Piccolo then notes that Goku could barely stand a month in the chamber in his youth, but Goku simply says that he will take Vegeta and Future Trunks as well. Krillin asks if he is scared or excited that their new foes are stronger than Frieza, and Goku replies that he is both. He and Gohan then teleport away to where Vegeta and Future Trunks are training. They see Future Trunks sitting while Vegeta stands alone on a ledge. Future Trunks says that his father will not train with him, and views him as a mistake, and his simply stood on the ledge for the past three days. Goku approaches Vegeta, who tells him to get lost. Goku tells him about the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, and Vegeta agrees to go in with Future Trunks as long as they can use it first. Goku readily agrees. Meanwhile, the androids arrive at Goku's House, only to find it deserted. Android 17 asks Android 16 if he knows where they might be, and Android 16 replies that Goku will either be at Capsule Corporation or at Kame House, and gives their locations. The trio decide to head to Kame House, the closer of the two.
 The Androids discover the Z Fighters location, much to Piccolo's shock On the Lookout, Mr. Popo takes the Z Fighters to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. Vegeta asks Goku why he suggested this to him as well, as killing Goku is his eventual plan. Goku says that they cannot defeat their current enemies alone, and Vegeta says that Goku might regret this later. Vegeta and Future Trunks enter the chamber, and Future Trunks immediately notes that the room is hot, with thin air and high gravity. He is taken aback by the room's vast amount of sheer nothingness, and says that it would drive anyone insane. Vegeta says that the room is perfect, and Future Trunks wonders if he can stand a year alone with his father. Meanwhile, Piccolo, Yamcha, Tien Shinhan, and Krillin have still not managed to find Cell, and Piccolo says that they may need Goku and Vegeta to transcend the Super Saiyan state and work together. The next day, Piccolo watches the news of Cell's attacks on TV while the others sleep. Just then, he senses something outside, and sees the trio of androids standing outside Kame House. Android 16 states that Goku is not there. Piccolo wakes up the others, and Android 17 asks where Goku is, saying that he will make them talk if necessary. Piccolo says he wants to see Android 17 try, and points out an uninhabited island nearby where they can fight. After telling the others to stay there, he and the androids fly over. Krillin hopes Piccolo can hold out until the first two Saiyans return, while Piccolo tells Android 17 he will not go down so easy this time.

Piccolo vs. Android #17,367 (DBZ 173),"The cover of the chapter features information about the Red Ribbon Androids.
 Piccolo powers up against Android 17 The Androids arrive at Kame House looking for Goku, but find Piccolo who decides to challenge them. The Androids accept the challenge and travel to some nearby islands to stage their battle. Piccolo, now fused with Kami, is confident in his strength and decides to fight the Androids one at a time to destroy them so Cell cannot be complete. Android 16 notes that there has been a strange change in Piccolo. Piccolo attacks Android 17 first and the battle begins. As the battle rages the two fight on a near equal level. Android 17 is confused as he notes that Piccolo is now stronger then Goku according to his Database. Nonetheless, Android 17 concludes that Piccolo will eventually get tired and lose. Impatient, Android 18 says she can beat Piccolo and offers to tag in, but Android 17 declines the offer.
 Piccolo's Hellzone Grenade blasts surround Android 17 To Piccolo's horror Cell shows up to join the battle. The Androids do not know who Cell is and tell him to leave. Cell charges up scaring Piccolo (17 and 18 cannot sense power levels). Piccolo wonders how many thousands of people he had to absorb to gain that much ki since their last encounter. Cell starts his attack on Android 17 to absorb him. Piccolo tries to help Android 17, but both are over powered by Cell. Piccolo is blasted by Cell and thought to be killed. Cell then starts attacking Android 17 again, of whom tries to fight to no avail. Android 18 questions why 17 is losing since he is supposed to be the ultimate Android. To her surprise, Android 16 reveals that he is in fact the superior model and stronger than Cell in his imperfect form. Android 16 than goes to rescue Android 17 and battle Cell.
"
Waiting in the Wings,368 (DBZ 174),"The cover of the chapter features Piccolo and Android 17 facing each other with Android 18 and Android 16 watching the battle in the foreground, and a large Cell in his imperfect form in the background.
 Android 17 attacks Piccolo Piccolo and Android 17 continue their desperate struggle, with both of them almost tied in terms of power. Unfortunately for Piccolo, Android 17 has the advantage by having an infinite energy flow, thus, he cannot feel fatigue. Piccolo and Android 17 descend back to the ground after fighting in the air for a long period of time. Android 17 lands near Android 16 and Android 18, and praises Piccolo for his surprising newfound strength. Android 17 though, still maintaining his egotistical attitude, informs Piccolo he is still far superior, and that Piccolo's newfound strength will still not be enough to totally decimate the Androids. Android 17 now orders Piccolo to tell of Goku's location, something the Androids have wanted to know due to their programming by the late Dr. Gero, who wanted revenge on Goku for destroying the Red Ribbon Army and his career. Piccolo, calm and collected, smirks menacingly, telling Android 17 that it will take more than petty threats and a beating to squeeze the information out of him. Not feeling sorry for his opponent, Android 17 promises he will not give Piccolo any mercy, and will now fight seriously. Android 17 lands right next to the concentrating Piccolo, who is now preparing a clever tactic. As Android 17 and Piccolo stare at each other, not flinching or slightly moving, Android 17 manages to land a strike on Piccolo's face, which was far too fast for Piccolo to even attempt to dodge.
 Android 17 vs. Piccolo Piccolo quickly recovers and tries to make a comeback, attempting to strike 17 in the face also. However, Android 17 ducks and dodges swiftly and calmly, then managing to land a devastating stomach punch, which causes Piccolo to fall slowly in pain. Android 17 speeds Piccolo's falling by elbowing him in the back, knocking him fast first into the dust and grass of the island. Now recovering once again, Piccolo dodges a quick kick from Android 17, backflipping away from 17. Piccolo cracks his stiff neck, not showing any visible signs of weakening or slowing down, and compliments Android 17 on his amazing speed, but that his punches are quite lacking in force. 17, surprised Piccolo as managed to withstand so many attacks, replies that Piccolo is far too confident for his own benefit, and that he will soon learn not to mock an obviously stronger opponent. Android 17 makes a running dash towards Piccolo, his eyes cold and menacing, as he prepares another fatal strike. Piccolo raises his right arm in preparation and attempts a karate chop on Android 17's neck, however, the Android is still too fast for Piccolo to hit, and 17 manages to dodge the attack and flip behind Piccolo, kneeing him directly in his skull. Piccolo retaliates by kicking Android 17 directly in his face. Android 17 makes an even quicker comeback by punching Piccolo as he recovers, but Piccolo once again strikes back by head-butting his foe, making the android fly back many feet, destroying the ground nearby. Android 18 still looks on in surprise and intrigue, amazed and confused as to how Piccolo has gained so much strength in such little time, as Piccolo could not even stand against the Androids in their first encounter. Piccolo and Android 17 continue to dish out more attacks and block them, with neither of them seeming to either give in or tire.
 The battle rages on Nearby, Cell continues to fly at high speeds, searching for Android 17 and 18 so he can absorb and consume them, in order to reach his perfect state, an unbeatable monster. Cell notices that Piccolo's ki is at high levels and moving around very quickly, meaning he must be fighting some powerful opponent. As Cell cannot feel another source of energy in the same location, Cell figures out it must be one of the androids, as the Androids do not have a Ki Sense that is trackable. Cell now laughs with menace and excitement, now rushing to finally attain his dream and desire, his perfect form. At the Kame House, Tien Shinhan and Krillin also feel Piccolo's energy spiking, and wish they were more powerful so they could help their ally, but Master Roshi insists there is nothing that either of them could do, and that they'd only be a distraction, and therefore, a disadvantage for Piccolo. Tien now senses Cell's ki, and begins to feel absolute dread and worry, knowing how strong the beast is, and that Piccolo will not stand much of a chance with both Cell and 17 to deal with. Chi-Chi runs outside the house to inform Krillin that Bulma is on the phone and wishes to speak to him urgently about a major discovery about the Androids design. Bulma tells Krillin she has found a weakness both Android 17 and Android 18 each have, an emergency off switch, something Dr. Gero built and once planned to use in case either of the Androids stood out of line or tried to betray their creator. Bulma informs Krillin she has a new remote device to shut down the Androids ready, and Krillin urgently orders Bulma to fly over and give it to him now, so he can assist Piccolo in the battle. Tien now begins to feel a slight glimpse of hope, and says Cell will be much less a threat if the two things that he needs to complete his evolution are destroyed. Krillin however, feels doubt and slight sadness that he will have to destroy Android 18, as he has developed an infatuation for Android 18 when she kissed his cheek after she and Android 17 defeated the Dragon Team on the Mountain Road.
 Meanwhile, still waiting on The Lookout for Vegeta and Future Trunks to emerge from the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Gohan and Goku now notice Cell's energy rushing towards Piccolo's. Goku now loses his patience with Vegeta, and knows Vegeta should have achieve a new state of the Super Saiyan form by now. Gohan begins to feel woe for his mentor Piccolo, as Cell gets closer and closer to him.
 Cell rushes to the battle between Piccolo and Android 17 Piccolo and Android 17 continue to brawl, with Android 17 now at the slight advantage. Piccolo, now getting frustrated his energy is being wasted on useless melee attacks, decides to fire a power Explosive Demon Wave to finally disintegrate Android 17. The powerful Android dodges the attack just barely, and now also he starts to lose patience. Piccolo now begins to breathe heavily in tiredness, which makes Android 17 grin sadistically, reminding Piccolo that he has infinite flowing energy coursing through him. Piccolo however, pays no attention to the Android, as he suddenly feels a powerful energy source; Cell has finally arrived, and looks down upon Piccolo and the androids with glee, preparing to finally achieve his perfect state and become the most powerful entity the universe will ever know.
"
Cell vs. the Androids,369 (DBZ 175),"The cover of the chapter features Goku sitting on the floor on The Lookout.
 On a deserted, far away island from any civilization, the woeful, fearful Piccolo, and the confused, intrigued Android 17 stop their ongoing struggle and look at the odd entity who has just arrived on the island, Cell. Eager and sadistic, Cell looks upon Piccolo and Android 17 as nothing more than petty prey, nothing that can stand even near its own feet. Piccolo, growling at the beast's appearance, regrets not noticing the monster while he was fighting Android 17. Android 17 stops his dazing to ask Piccolo what the creature even is, as he notices Piccolo seems to know who, or what, it is. Piccolo becomes surprised at Android 17's lacking knowledge of Cell, thinking that Cell and the Androids would have been working together.
 Imperfect Cell powers up Cell opens its mouth in great anticipation, and states that this day has been delayed for far too long, but now is the time where it can finally absorb Android 17 and Android 18, and achieve the perfect state of being it has desired since its creation. Cell also notices Android 16, gazing emotionlessly towards Cell. Despite not knowing who Android 16 is, Cell assumes with confidence he must be a lower, and weaker model than the others, and weak enough to safely ignore. As Cell descends from the higher rocky formation of the island, he begins to charge his ki, to prepare to swiftly take care of Piccolo and easily absorb the androids without any hassle. Piccolo notices how much Cell's ki has rose sharply since their last battle, meaning Cell must have absorbed many more victims while Piccolo and the other Z Fighters were searching for him with no luck. Cell manages to completely decimate the entire rocky mountain area of the island just by charging, leaving Piccolo now no choice, but to attack. However, Piccolo stops all effort, and stands frightful and stiff, as Cell just walks past the astounded Namekian, and proceeds to absorb Android 17 first. Before Cell can proceed with an attack, Piccolo demands to know how many victims Cell has just absorbed. Cell chuckles, and states to they are not victims, but part of something greater, something worthwhile, and something much more amazing than anything they will ever achieve in their lifetimes.
 Cell attacks #17 Back at Kame House, Krillin, Roshi, Chi-Chi and Tien Shinhan wait anxiously for a result from Piccolo, Cell, and the Androids confrontation. As Tien feels no hope whatsoever now that Cell has increased in power, Roshi states it will take about 20 minutes for Bulma to arrive with the emergency turn-off switch for Android 17 and Android 18, but Krillin realizes he can just fly to Bulma, and it will only take about a minute or two. As Krillin speeds off, Tien watches in awe as Krillin now has something to do to help the cause. Tien now decides he needs to assist Piccolo, no matter how much stronger the Androids may be. Despite Roshi's persuasions and demands to stay, Tien flies off towards the island, and prepares to assist Piccolo in the deadly battle. Angry he cannot assist in the slightest, Roshi becomes amazed there were even days where he was considered the strongest on Earth.
 Piccolo stops Cell from absorbing #17 Back on the island, Cell, and Android 17 look at each other, with Cell feeling excitement, while 17 feels annoyance. Android 17 demands that Cell leaves immediately so that he can get back to his fun battle with Piccolo, but Cell stands silent, preparing its strategy. Piccolo realizes Cell is preparing an absorption, and begs for Android 17 to run immediately. Android 17 now notices Cell's tail rising too, and prepares to dodge any attack thrown at him. Cell now uses its tail in a swift and deadly swipe, slightly missing Android 17. As Android 17 continues to quickly dodge Cell's attacks, Cell grabs 17 by his right arm, and throws him into the ground, creating a large dust pile and crack in the island. As Cell grins, Piccolo just in time manages to directly kick Cell on the side of its head, knocking him away from 17. As 17 recovers and lifts himself up, he asks Piccolo why the creature needs to absorb him. Piccolo begins to explain simply and shortly that Cell is a creature that started creation by Dr. Gero himself, but was left to Gero's Supercomputer once Gero realized a human mind, and the little time he had, was not enough to finish the revolutionary project. Cell carries on Piccolo's explanation and persuades Android 17 that the power unlocked from the absorption will be beyond comparison, and the ultimate super-being will be decided and created. Despite Cell's attempts, Android 17 refuses to even be associated with Cell, and once again orders him to get lost or he will suffer from Android 17's lack of compassion. Calling Android 17 powerful, but not intellectual, states it was never a choice, and that the absorption will carry on with or without Android 17's permission. Android 17 interrupts to state Cell will not stand the slightest chance, however, finally speaking, Android 16 orders Android 17 to stand down, and move away from Cell as far as he can, telling Android 17 Cell is far beyond both him and Piccolo. Now surprised Android 16 is actually speaking, Android 17 is disappointed that the first thing he speaks about is cowardice. Ignoring Android 16's plea, Android 17 rushes towards Cell with great contempt. Without any effort, Cell elbows the confident Android 17 into the ground, and Piccolo rushes into the scene in absolute fear, worrying Cell will achieve a much more powerful state, where nothing can even try to stop him for conquering the world, and eventually, destroying the entire universe.
"
New Piccolo...Last Piccolo?,370 (DBZ 176),"The cover of this chapter shows panels of Piccolo charging toward Imperfect Cell from behind to give him a punch only for Cell to block Piccolo's punch with his fist.
 The monstrous Cell looks upon the damaged Android 17 with sadistic glee, preparing to finally absorb him and acquire the perfect state of power. Piccolo, frantic with fear, rushes towards Cell, before he can attempt an absorption. Cell easily blocks Piccolo's attack with his arm, elbowing and punching Piccolo directly in his face, knocking the Namekian into the ground with a loud crash. As Piccolo places his hand on his bleeding cheek, groaning in pain, Cell looks upon Piccolo lowly, as nothing more than an insect in the whole scheme of things. Cell kicks the recovering Piccolo far into the distance, as Piccolo collides into a mountain-side on the island. Android 18 and Android 16 watch the battle unfold, with Android 18 commenting that 17 and Piccolo must be going easy on the creature, still believing 17 is the strongest being on the planet. 16 corrects her by saying that Piccolo has been using his entire power against the beast, and the beast is just much stronger than both of them. 16 orders 18 to run as far away as she can, otherwise Cell with absorb them both extremely soon, and nobody will stand a chance against him then. As 18 begins to wonder what 16 is going to do himself, Piccolo stands from his beating, and prepares a unique attack, aligning his hands, making a sphere shape. As Piccolo charges up the Energy Sphere in his palms, Cell does not move a muscle or even attempt to dodge, while Android 17 runs away from Piccolo to avoid possibly getting caught in the beam or its explosion. Piccolo orders Cell to prepare itself for this final assault, and fires the enormous attack, decimating a massive chunk of the island as the Androids watch in awe, except 16. 18 praises Piccolo's power, thinking the creature is destroyed. However, Android 16 immediately states the being is not even damaged or dented by the attack. Cell slowly rises itself from the ocean, with not even a slight visible scar. Piccolo, now distressed and confused as to how even Cell could remain unharmed after that attack, cannot move, clenching his fists in anger over how helpless the situation is. Cell slowly, and mockingly walks towards the devastated Piccolo, as Tien Shinhan, who had just recently arrived, looks in awe over Cell's strength and endurance from a good distance away. Now standing right next to Piccolo, Cell continues to stay silent, looking upon his helpless opponent in a stoic stare. Piccolo suddenly pleads to 17 to run away now, and make sure Cell cannot find him. Cell finishes Piccolo's order by punching him directly in his face. As Piccolo falls to the ground, Cell notices he managed to break Piccolo's neck in the impact, as Tien watches in horror and disgust. Cell grins and laughs, wondering to himself if he got carried away and absorbed too many people than necessary. Cell finally finishes his paralyzed, helpless opponent by blasting through Piccolo's stomach with a large beam. As 17, 18, and Tien watch in shock and distress, Cell manages to completely disintegrate one-third of Piccolo's torso.
 Back on The Lookout, Gohan and Goku, who are waiting for Vegeta and Future Trunks to finish in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber so they can get started, notice Piccolo's energy suddenly disappear, coming to the conclusion Piccolo was killed by the other strong life-force fighting there, Cell. As Gohan screams in distraught for his old master, Goku suddenly becomes even more impatient, ordering that Vegeta and Future Trunks finish immediately and destroy Cell while he has not absorbed one of the Androids, hoping that either Future Trunks or Vegeta have achieved a new state of Super Saiyan by now. Now feeling slight woe for Piccolo's gruesome demise, Android 17 states to Cell he will not go down as easily. 18 wishes that 17 had listened to 16's orders earlier, and had run when he had Piccolo to protect him. 16 now orders 18 to run once again, and informs her he will destroy Cell, shocking 18. 16 decides he must use his power now, even though his original plan was to only use this power against Goku. As 16 prepares to fight, Cell now has defeated one of the few Z Fighters who could stand a slight chance, and now prepares himself to absorb 17, and finally achieve the perfect form he has desired ever since his creation by Dr. Gero.

Cell vs. Android #16,371 (DBZ 177),"The cover of this chapter shows the Dragon Team on one side, the Red Ribbon Androids on the other side, and Cell in the middle. Half of the Z Fighters, specifically Tien Shinhan, Yamcha, Krillin, and Future Trunks, also proceeded to flip the bird at Cell. This cover art is also featured in Daizenshuu 1.
 Android 16 approaches Cell, much to the astonishment of Tien Shinhan and Android 18. After Android 17 is beaten and nearly absorbed by him, Cell is punched into the air by Android 16. Figuring that he and Cell are about equal in power, Android 16 charges at him, but is knocked to the ground. He then resists Cell's attempt to attack him with his stinger, and pulls his tail out, hoping to prevent Android 17 from being absorbed. However (due to the presence of Piccolo's cells), his tail grows right back. Android 16 realizes that he must kill Cell so he will not achieve his perfect form, and attempts to kick him, only to be knocked back when Cell counters with two punches. 16 then launches his fist at Cell to retaliate.
"
#16 Summons His Power,372 (DBZ 178),"The cover shows a bruised Android 16 standing behind a bruised Android 17 while they're in a battle against Cell.
 Having been hit with Android 16's Rocket Punch, Cell flies backwards. As he dashes after his opponent, 16 grabs and reattaches his fist. He punches Cell to the ground, then grabs him and raises him overhead. He angrily throws Cell to the ground, creating a deep hole. Android 17, amazed at this display of power, watches in shock as 16 detaches both of his hands. 16 then unleashes a Hell's Flash into the hole. The attack creates a shockwave, and energy beams fly out of the ground throughout the area. Krillin, still flying to meet Bulma, wonders what has happened. He notes that Piccolo cannot be the cause of this, as his ki is gone.
  
Meanwhile, Android 16 looks into the hole to see the damage he has done. He reattaches his hands as Tien Shinhan and the other androids continue to stare in shock. 16 notices that Android 18 is still there, and says that he told her to run. 18 says that will not be necessary now that Cell has been defeated, but 16 says she is wrong. He says that Cell, while injured, will not die so easily. He again implores 17 and 18 to escape, but 17 refuses, saying that he wants payback and can now finish a wounded Cell. As 17 taunts Cell to come back out, Cell begins to emerge from the ground behind him. Tien notices Cell's plan and yells out to 17, but Cell quickly emerges and begins to absorb the android with his tail.
  16 dashes towards Cell, but stops short, noticing that 17 has already been absorbed whole. Cell then begins to glow and starts to transform, and 16 tells 18 that they are leaving, and tells Tien to do the same. On The Lookout, Goku and Gohan feel a large increase in Cell's ki, and Goku realizes that Cell must have absorbed one of the androids. Cell is shown, grinning, in his new Semi-Perfect form.
"
The New Cell,373 (DBZ 179),"The cover features Semi-Perfect Cell in a purple background while he smiles.
 Cell is newly transformed after absorbing Android 17. Android 16 and Android 18 gaze at Cell in horror, as Cell turns toward the two androids. As Cell tenses his body in preparation to attack, Android 16 suddenly grabs Android 18, saying that they must escape. Android 16 takes flight still clutching Android 18, but Cell also flies at the pair of androids and quickly overtakes them. Android 16 freezes in the air, amazed at Cell's speed. Tien Shinhan, looking on at the scene, watches in shock. He stands up straight, and reflects that he might be killed, and apologizes to an absent Chiaotzu.
 Meanwhile, Cell taunts Android 18 and Android 16, saying that they cannot escape from him, and that, thanks to Android 17, he surprised even himself with his new speed. He wonders aloud how strong he has become, and a furious Android 16 throws a punch at Cell. It hits Cell in the face, but he does not seem to be fazed, and smiles at a shocked Android 16. Cell proceeds to outstretch his palm and blast Android 16, sending him flying and crashing into the ground. Cell remarks that he has become stronger as well, as a terrified Android 18 looks on.
 Cell turns towards 18 and says that she is smart not to try to escape. He then says that it is her turn to be absorbed and that he will soon attain his Perfect Form. However, Android 18 holds her hand to her chest and warns Cell not to come any closer, threatening to destroy herself if he does. After glaring at 18, Cell starts speaking in Android 17's voice. Posing as Android 17, he tells Android 18 that it is great to be part of Cell and that it is the only way to be strong. He also urges Android 18 to let herself be absorbed. Android 18's resolve seems to waver, but Android 16, with half of his head blown off, warns Android 18 that it is merely a trick. Cell retorts to Android 16 that a robot cannot understand how he and Android 18 feel, and that he should not interfere. He continues to attempt to persuade Android 18. He says that she should join him in order to achieve the ultimate power, but makes the mistake of saying that if she joins him, they will be able to fulfill the ""great"" Dr. Gero's wishes. Android 18 then realizes that it was not Android 17 speaking, as Android 17 and Android 18 hated Dr. Gero, and would never praise him.
 Cell scowls at Android 18, and says that if she will not willingly join him, he will absorb her by force. He remarks that it would take her longer to charge up a blast strong enough to destroy herself than it would take him to get to her. He tells her to surrender, but suddenly sees the floating figure of Tien above him, preparing to attack.
 Tien then shoots a Neo Tri-Beam at a startled Cell, catching him off guard and blasting him into the ground, leaving a gaping hole. When he sees Android 16 and Android 18 merely standing in surprise, he shouts at them to run away. Cell attempts to resurface, but Tien forces him back down with another blast. Android 18 flies over to Android 16 and asks him if he can fly. Android 16 says that he can. Tien then shoots yet another Tri-Beam at Cell. Meanwhile, at The Lookout, Goku is watching the scene with Gohan, and yells at Tien to stop, or he will die.
"
Goku Meets Cell,374 (DBZ 180),"The cover features Semi-Perfect Cell in a white background while giving a bow to the readers.
 Goku tells Tien to stop Tien Shinhan continues firing Neo Tri-Beams at Cell, as Android 18 helps Android 16 to his feet and shouts that this is their chance to escape. The pair of androids take flight, and Cell, still struggling against the barrage of blasts, turns his head and sees them flying away.
 As Tien continues his attack, at The Lookout, Goku and Gohan are watching the events unfold. Goku shouts to Tien to stop using the Tri-Beam. After one final blast that sends Cell flying downwards, a sweaty and panting Tien goes limp in the air. With his eyelids drooping, he falls and slams into the ground. Goku watches this happen in shock.
 Cell emerges from the hole that he was sent into by Tien. He looks around, but cannot find anyone. Eventually, he turns around and sees Tien. He remarks to himself that though Tien is not particularly strong, he was able to get in the way. Cell outstretches his palm, preparing to fire a blast at Tien. Cell notes to himself that Tien will most likely die, but he decides to finish Tien anyway.
 Goku meeting Cell At this moment, Goku suddenly teleports away from the Lookout, leaving a surprised Mr. Popo and Gohan behind. He appears in front of a struggling Tien, to the surprise of Cell. Goku glares at Cell, and Cell shouts ""Goku!"" Goku says ""so, you're Cell"". Cell, however, stares back in wonder at how Goku was able to get there. Goku states that at his current strength, he cannot defeat Cell, but that if Cell waits one more day, Goku will be able to defeat him. A bemused Cell laughs and says that he did not expect to hear that. He sardonically asks Goku if he is saying that he will beat him tomorrow. At Goku's assent, Cell asks Goku what could change so much in a single day.
 At this moment, however, Goku suddenly looks around. He shouts that he sensed Piccolo's ki. Cell merely looks puzzled and says ""what?"" Goku grabs Tien's wrist and tells him to stay close. Goku then teleports with Tien in tow to the edge of a body of water. There he sees an unconscious Piccolo with half his body above the water. Piccolo appears to have been trying to climb over the edge of the island, but losing consciousness halfway through and merely flopping his upper half down onto the ground.
 As Goku dashes over to Piccolo, Cell notices that Goku is suddenly quite a distance away from where he was standing a few seconds earlier. Cell wonders aloud at how Goku was able to reach Piccolo so quickly. Goku assures Tien and Piccolo that they are now safe and that there are Senzu Beans back at the Lookout. Cell smirks and says they will not be able to run away. He flies at Goku, ready to throw a punch, but Goku vanishes and Cell's punch hits thin air. He turns around and says to himself that Goku is gone, and wonders where he learned such a strange technique. Cell then decides that he has to find Android 18 first, and Goku is nothing at that point. He says that Android 18 cannot have gone far with 16, and immediately flies off.
 Goku vanishes as Cell tries to punch him Meanwhile, Krillin is flying when he sees Bulma's ship. The two notice each other and stop in mid-air. Bulma is surprised to see Krillin, and Krillin explains that he flew over to get the Shut Down Remote from Bulma. Bulma hands it to him and explains that he needs to be within 10 meters for the remote to work. Krillin says that that distance is rather close. Bulma also says that she made more Battle Armor for Vegeta and the others and asks Krillin to give them to the others. Krillin says that they are not staying with him and that Bulma should take the armor to Kami's Lookout, above Korin Tower. Bulma wishes Krillin good luck and flies away in her ship. Meanwhile, at the Lookout, Goku, Tien, Piccolo, and Gohan are in intense discussion. Piccolo says that Cell's power is unnatural and unbeatable. Mr. Popo then comes running in and says Vegeta and Future Trunks just came out of the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. Goku says ""finally"" as Future Trunks, preceding Vegeta, emerges with a serious expression on his face.
"
Vegeta and Trunks Emerge,375 (DBZ 181),"The cover of this chapter shows Vegeta and Future Trunks on The Lookout in their Battle Armor.
 Future Trunks and Vegeta emerge from the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. Future Trunks apologizes from keeping the rest of the Dragon Team waiting. Goku remarks that the pair of Saiyans took a long time. Future Trunks states that Vegeta surpassed the Super Saiyan form within two months, but, unsatisfied with his power, he continued training and became more proficient. Vegeta cuts off Future Trunks and tells him not to say any more. Goku asks Vegeta if the training worked, to which Vegeta replies that it would be pointless for Goku to train in the room, as he will destroy Cell as well as the androids. Piccolo and Tien Shinhan appear surprised by this boast. Goku says that he saw Cell after his absorption of Android 17, and that he is a monster. Vegeta merely smirks.
 Goku tells Vegeta about Cell's transformation At this moment, Bulma's voice is heard, asking if everyone is there. The Z Fighters spot Bulma and Goku asks her what she is doing at The Lookout. Bulma says that Krillin told her she would find them there. She suddenly notices Future Trunks, who has longer hair after his year in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. She asks if he is really Future Trunks, and walks up to him and touches his hair asking why he changed his hair or if it is a wig, and also exclaims that he has grown taller. Future Trunks explains that there is a room where one can spend a year in the span of a day, and that he and Vegeta were training in there. Bulma notes that Vegeta's hair did not grow. Vegeta explains that the hair of pure-blooded Saiyans do not grow. Goku says ""Oh! No wonder!"", but Vegeta cuts in and asks why they are talking about hair, and proceeds to ask Bulma why she came to the Lookout.
 Vegeta says that the hair of pure Saiyans never changes after birth Bulma says that she made battle suits for everyone. She takes out a capsule and the contents are revealed. Future Trunks dons the armor. Goku picks a suit up and remarks that they are lighter than they appear. Gohan remarks that he wore this armor on Namek. Bulma sees Piccolo standing to the side with his arms folded and asks him why he is not wearing the suit. Piccolo replies that he cannot wear the same costumes as Saiyans or Frieza and his men. Goku playfully says that they are just clothes, and easy to move in. Vegeta says that, as he said before, that suit will only be wasted and Goku will not see any action. Goku says ""Because you're going to defeat Cell, right?"", and says that he would not complain if that happened. Vegeta smiles confidently, and Goku asks Vegeta if he is leaving, offering to teleport him there. Vegeta says that he needs no help from Goku and flies off.
 Bulma says that Vegeta has an attitude and Future Trunks says the he should leave now, but Goku stops him and gives him some Senzu Beans for him and Vegeta. Goku tells Future Trunks to do his best, but not to push himself or his luck too hard, and says that it is okay if he escapes if it becomes too dangerous. Future Trunks says that he will, thanks Goku, and wishes him good luck with his training. Bulma says that Future Trunks and Vegeta better not die. Future Trunks waves goodbye and also flies away. Goku then says to an eager Gohan that it is their turn to train.
 Meanwhile, Cell continues flying on his search for Android 18 and Android 16. He suddenly stops and remarks to himself that with their speed, he should have caught up to them already. Since he cannot see them, they must be hiding in one of the islands below. Cell sucks in air to his lungs, and yells extremely loud for 18 to show herself or he will destroy the islands one by one. He continues yelling saying that he is not bluffing, and that though he wants to be complete, he is already the strongest on the planet. The residents of a city on one of the islands panic, wondering what the terrible voice from the sky could be.
 Meanwhile, Android 16 and Android 18 are hiding on a nearby island, and Android 18 remarks that Cell would indeed destroy all the islands along with her. Android 16 assures Android 18 that she will be fine; Cell is too obsessed with completion. Elsewhere, a confident Vegeta flies towards Cell and the inevitable battle.
"
Vegeta's Confidence,376 (DBZ 182),"The cover shows Super Saiyan Vegeta and Semi-Perfect Cell in a face-off.
 Cell continues yelling for Android 18 to come out of hiding. When nothing happens, Cell frowns and realizes that 18 will not show herself, calling her a fool. He then turns his gaze to the city on the island below, deciding to destroy it in order to flush 18 out.
 The citizens below, meanwhile, see Cell floating in the sky. One citizen wonders if Cell is the one yelling. A child wonders aloud why Cell is floating, and an old man exclaims that Cell is a devil. Cell then outstretches his palm to destroy the island. A huge Big Bang Crash flies toward the city. As the civilians look on in confusion, the attack hits the island, completely destroying it in a flash of bright light and causing massive waves in the ocean. Cell looks at the destruction with no emotion, deciding that 18 was not on that particular island. He yells again, saying that one island has been destroyed and time is running out until her island is destroyed.
 Android 18 watches from a distance and notices the explosion's impact on the previous island, as smoke rises from the water. She exclaims to Android 16 that Cell is destroying the islands. Damaged after being attacked by Cell earlier, Android 16 tells 18 not to worry, and that Cell is holding back his blasts to avoid killing her, as he would never risk his dream of perfection. 18 points out that even if she does survive the impact of the blasts, 16 would be destroyed in his condition. 16 begins to wonder why Cell is even bothering to achieve his perfect state, as it seems to be invincible already. Cell, meanwhile, continues blasting the islands in quick succession.
 Flying nearby after completing his training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Vegeta notices the destruction, and transforms into a Super Saiyan. He increases his speed and heads towards Cell's location.
 Android 16 and Android 18, meanwhile, brace themselves against the force of an explosion as this time, the island located right next to the island 18 and 16 are currently hiding is destroyed. Android 18 exclaims that Cell is already on the island beside them, but 16 urges her to stay put and ride out the attack, as Cell is merely watching to see if anyone will fly up. Now reaching the androids' island, Cell holds out his hand yet again, saying to himself that the androids are not emerging, and that though the androids should know not to hide underwater, he may have to search the ocean.
 As 18 prepares for the blast, Cell notices a distant figure flying at him. It is Vegeta, who zooms towards Cell until they are face to face. Shocked, Cell identifies Vegeta while Vegeta identifies Cell, and Vegeta tells Cell to get down. Cell and Vegeta descend onto the ground of the island, and 16 and 18 look on. Cell asks Vegeta why he came there, saying that he cannot defeat him. Vegeta replies by stating he will not defeat Cell, he will pulverize him. Cell smirks doubtfully and jeers at Vegeta. Vegeta continues taunting Cell, saying that he is disgusted his cells were used to create something so ugly. 18 says that Vegeta has gone insane, as not even a few days ago, Vegeta was easily defeated by Android 18 herself.
 Behind Cell and Vegeta, Future Trunks arrives on the battlefield. Cell notes the presence of Future Trunks, saying that it the number does not matter, and that he can wait for more allies. Vegeta tells Cell that Future Trunks is nothing but a spectator, and that Vegeta alone should suffice to kill Cell.
"
Beyond the Super Saiyan,377 (DBZ 183),"The cover of this chapter shows Gohan and Goku in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.
 After Vegeta's boast about being able to send Cell to the grave alone, Cell asks Vegeta in disbelief if Vegeta really said he alone would suffice to send Cell to the grave. Vegeta assents, and taunts Cell, asking him if he is hard of hearing. Cell laughs and says that he is merely stunned by the absurdity of the statement.
 Vegeta powers up Watching the scene, Android 18 says that Cell is right and that not even a miracle could give Vegeta victory. She then tells Android 16 that this is their chance to escape. A damaged 16, however, tells 18 to wait until the fighters are occupied. He also says that Vegeta's power has increased significantly. 18 is surprised, and says that Vegeta could not have changed in such a short time, and that he was not holding back in their earlier fight. Vegeta tells Cell to watch closely, saying that he will wipe Cell's smile off his face. Future Trunks is spectating the scene and thinks to himself in surprise that he is going to transform already. Vegeta begins to charge his ki while Cell smirks.
 At The Lookout, Piccolo, Tien Shinhan, and Bulma are waiting, and Piccolo says that the battle has started, and Vegeta's power is increasing. Tien says that Vegeta's power is inconceivable, and Piccolo walks to the edge of the lookout to see what lies beyond the Super Saiyan.
 Vegeta transformed into a 2nd Grade Super Saiyan Meanwhile, in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Gohan looks around in wonder at the whiteness of the room. He also notes the heat, lack of oxygen, and extra gravity. Goku says that as the door closes, everything else is shut out, and that they can no longer sense Vegeta and Cell's ki. Goku then shows Gohan around, pointing out the bathroom and pantry. He then tells Gohan to go forward in order to see why Goku could not stand the place when he was a child. Gohan sees that the room is huge, and says that there seems to not be an end, even though it is all in a room. Goku says that it is supposed to be the same size as Earth, and to be careful not to wander and get lost. Goku also explains that the temperature can change from negative forty degrees to one hundred twenty, and that it is a blank world with a quarter of the air and ten times the gravity of Earth. Gohan asks in consternation if they have to stay for a year. Goku says that they should start training immediately. He says that they will turn Gohan into a Super Saiyan. Gohan seems doubtful that he can turn into one, but Goku assures him that with his Saiyan blood, he can. Gohan asks if he is delaying Goku's training, to which Goku says yes, but that once he turns Super Saiyan, he will be an excellent sparring partner. Goku elaborates, saying that once he surpasses Super Saiyan, he will be stronger than anyone, but that he wants Gohan to be even stronger. Gohan is taken aback and even more doubtful, and says that Future Trunks said that in the future, he is a Super Saiyan, but he is killed by the androids. Goku points out that future is already different, and that in that future, Gohan did not train in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.
 At the island, Vegeta continues powering up. Piccolo says that his power is still increasing, and 16, 18, and a nervous Cell watch as, with a crack, Vegeta transforms into a Super Saiyan Second Grade. Cell seems surprised, and Vegeta smirks. Suddenly, Vegeta punches Cell in the stomach with tremendous force, starting the battle.
"
Super Vegeta,378 (DBZ 184),"The cover features Super Saiyan Second Grade Vegeta with both of his arms raised, seemingly charging his ki to prepare to make an attack against Cell as a noticeable aura of ki, in a panel with a dark blue background behind him, can be seen surrounding parts of his body while Vegeta prepares to make his move.
 Cell bends over in pain after a mighty punch from the Super Saiyan Second Grade Vegeta to his stomach. Vegeta draws his arm back and hits Cell again, sending him flying. As Cell hits the ground, Vegeta walks calmly forward. Cell jumps back up and glares at Vegeta. Vegeta asks Cell if he sees his power, and Cell smiles and says that Vegeta is not weak after all. Cell then throws a punch at Vegeta, but Vegeta grabs it and throws Cell to the ground. Cell attempts to get up, but Vegeta lifts his leg and kicks Cell to send him flying through a mountain.
 Meanwhile, Krillin is flying over an ocean with the Shut Down Remote in his hand. He notices Vegeta's ki and the fact that it is bigger than Cell's. He realizes that Vegeta used the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, and flies faster to take a look.
 Back at the island, Cell has landed in a great deal of rubble. Android 18 and Android 16 watch the battle is disbelief and shock. Cell struggles to his feet as Vegeta flies over to him. Cell says that he takes it that Vegeta really wants to fight, to which Vegeta replies that he thought they were fighting and that cell should not hold back on Vegeta's account. Cell chuckles and starts to charge his ki.
 In the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Gohan also starts raising his ki to try to become a Super Saiyan. Goku tells him that he is only raising his power, and that Gohan needs to get mad. Gohan says that it is difficult to merely stand there and get angry. Goku tells Gohan to imagine Cell is trying to kill him, but when Gohan points out that he has never seen Cell, Goku changes it to Frieza. Gohan starts the attempt again, this time imagining Frieza, and his hair starts to rise. However, tired from the effort, Gohan collapses to his knees, saying that he cannot do it. Goku reassures Gohan that Vegeta and he had a lot of difficulty as well and that Gohan was doing well.
 Meanwhile, Cell finishes and reaches his maximum power. Vegeta notes that it was an improvement, but not enough. Future Trunks, surveying this scene, says to himself that his father has won. Krillin also reaches the island and confirms that it is indeed Vegeta and Cell fighting. Cell starts forward and strikes Vegeta in the face. Vegeta merely smiles and wipes the blood from his mouth to the astonishment of Cell. Cell asks Vegeta whether he really is Vegeta. Vegeta says that he is not quite Vegeta. He points to himself and says ""I am Super Vegeta!""

Cell's Last Chance,379 (DBZ 185),"
 
 The cover depicts Vegeta, in his Super Saiyan Second Grade form, holding Semi-Perfect Cell in a headlock.
 Cell is taken aback by Vegeta's claim that he is now ""Super Vegeta,"" but Vegeta can't be bothered to explain, telling Cell he should be more worried about his own safety. Up above, Krillin, who had just arrived, sees Cell's new appearance, and thinking he's now in his perfect form, believes the Shut Down Remote is useless. Cell, furious at finding someone stronger than him, swings his tail at Vegeta, but Vegeta easily jumps over it and sends Cell flying with a kick, then follows up with a massive kick to Cell's stomach, followed by an elbow smash that drives Cell into the ocean.
 Krillin is taken aback by how powerful Vegeta has become, then notices Future Trunks, wondering if he became just as powerful too. He doesn't see Goku and Gohan, but then he sees Android 16 and Android 18, who are in hiding nearby. Noticing that Vegeta, Trunks, and Cell haven't noticed the androids, he realizes this is his chance to shut them down. He then remembers Bulma's warning that he has to be within ten meters away for it to work, and he descends, hoping to shut them down without them noticing. He realizes that if those Androids are still there, Cell must not be complete yet, and he notices Android 17's absence, realizing Cell must have absorbed him.
 Cell climbs out of the water, breathing heavily. Vegeta points out Trunks, claiming he has almost as much power as him. Vegeta is disappointed that Cell's power turned out to be so underwhelming. Cell yells in frustration, saying that if he could only achieve his Perfect Form, Vegeta would be no match for him. Meanwhile, Krillin is sneaking ever closer to the hidden androids.
"
The Evil Truce,380 (DBZ 186),"The Cover depicts Android 18, Krillin walking with the Shut Down Remote, and Semi-Perfect Cell in the background laughing.
 Cell is still cursing the fact that he hasn't reached his Perfect Form, but Vegeta floats down to him, intrigued. Vegeta asks if Cell meant what he said that if he obtained his Perfect Form, Cell could defeat him. Cell confirms it, saying the computer told him that, in his Perfect Form, his power, speed, skill, and mental strength would be perfect. At this, Vegeta kicks Cell away again.
 Android 18 believes that Vegeta might have only pretended to be weak when they fought prviously, but Android 16 states he'd have no reason to do that, and that something changed in the last few days. Krillin, meanwhile is getting closer, and finally gets within the 10 meter range. However, seeing Android 18, Krillin struggles to make himself push the button.
 Vegeta walks over to the rising Cell, asking him if even after how weak he is now, if turning Perfect would make him strong enough to beat him. Cell confirms it once again. Future Trunks starts to worry that his father might actually be considering letting Cell get his Perfect Form.
 Meanwhile, Krillin continues to struggle with the thought of shutting down Android 18, and finally can't bring himself to do it, dropping the Shut Down Remote. Android 18 reacts with shock, seeing the dropped remote, and wondering how Krillin could have gotten his hands on it, considering Android 17 crushed the one Dr. Gero had.
 Cell continues to goad Vegeta, knowing his Saiyan pride will want to fight Cell at his best, knowing Vegeta wants to see how powerful his Perfect Form is. Vegeta finally agrees, telling Cell to go obtain his Perfect Form, then come back to fight. As Cell goes to leave, however, Trunks cuts him off.
 Krillin apologizes to Bulma for all the effort she put into the remote, but crushes it under his boot, much to Android 18's shock. Cell yells at Vegeta to do something about Trunks, but then spots Android 18, realizing his Perfect Form is now within his reach!
"
Vegeta vs. Trunks?,381 (DBZ 187),"The cover of this chapter shows Semi-Perfect Cell standing arms crossed, with Future Trunks, Krillin and Android 18 behind him.
 Future Trunks looks over at what Cell is looking at, then he spots Android 18, and Krillin is with them. He realizes they do not know Cell has noticed them, and screams out ""Heeeeey! Cell has found you!"". Android 18, Android 16 and Krillin all freak out, and Cell flies toward them. Future Trunks says he will not let him reach his perfect form, then he bulks up like Vegeta and follows Cell. Vegeta thinks it is lucky the androids were here, and then tells Future Trunks he will not let him interfere. Future Trunks almost reaches Cell, but Vegeta kicks Future Trunks away, into a nearby mountain. Cell lands in front of them, and Android 18 and Android 16 prepare to fight him. Cell tells Android 16 not to do anything unreasonable while he is on the verge of shutting down, and says that Vegeta wants him to reach his perfect form, too. Kuririn curses Vegeta.
 Android 18 being absorbed Future Trunks gets up from the rubble and tells his dad he is mistaken, they can not let Cell reach his perfect form. Cell's power might become far greater than their own, and then what will they do? Vegeta asks Future Trunks if he wants to see how strong Cell will get, and Future Trunks says not at all. He has already seen it enough in his hellish future. He says even if he has to defeat his dad, he will stop Cell from reaching his perfect form. Vegeta doubts he can even attack his own father, never mind defeat him. Future Trunks then lets off a huge two-handed blast at Vegeta, and flies over toward Cell. Cell then uses a Solar Flare, blinding Future Trunks, Kuririn, Android 16, and Android 18. He opens his tail and absorbs up Android 18, and Future Trunks and Kuririn freak out when they regain their sight. Vegeta is surprised Future Trunks really did it, but notices that Cell is changing. He will finally see his perfect form.
"
The Complete Cell,382 (DBZ 188),"
 
 The cover shows the backside of Cell standing in front of a blue panel while finally in his perfect form, hiding his face.
 Vegeta, Future Trunks, Android 16, and Krillin watch as Cell, having just absorbed Android 18 starts to shake. Vegeta watches in anticipation, and the other three look on in fear and consternation. Cell begins to slowly change shape as Vegeta notes that Cell is transforming. Future Trunks, angry at his father, decides to beat down Cell while he still has a chance and charges at Cell. However, Cell creates an Energy Field around himself, which Future Trunks' kick slams against to no effect. Taken aback by his kick's lack of effect on Cell's barrier, Future Trunks throws a punch at Cell, but ends up merely hurting his hand. Suddenly, Cell's barrier flashes blindingly bright and explodes. Smoke flies around the cringing fighters as Perfect Cell's silhouette appears, and a satisfied Vegeta anticipates the coming fight.
 Meanwhile, at The Lookout, Piccolo is watching these events unfold, and upon seeing this, he says aloud that Cell is now complete. Tien Shinhan and Bulma are shocked, and Bulma asks if Krillin used her Shut Down Remote. Piccolo tells her that Krillin destroyed it intentionally, and that he cannot tell her why. Piccolo calls Vegeta an imbecile and warns him to finish the fight quickly.
 In the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Gohan struggles to become a Super Saiyan. Finally, he achieves the state, and Goku exclaims words of encouragement and congratulation. As Gohan continues to strain, Goku tells him to reign in his passion without losing the form. However, Gohan loses the state, and says that it is too difficult. Goku merely says that it takes work, and that he will cut Gohan's hair as it is getting shaggy.
 At the island, Cell emerges from the dust in his new form. Vegeta taunts Cell, saying that his new form does not look very fearsome. Krillin glares at Cell and calls him a murderer for absorbing Android 18. In his rage, and ignoring Future Trunks' warning, Krillin attacks Cell, hitting him with a punch, but it does not seem to affect Cell, who merely continues examining his new body. When his punch does not affect cell, Krillin kicks Cell multiple times, but nothing happens, and Krillin becomes fearful. Cell punches the air a few times to test his strength, and with a smile and a yell, he turns around effortlessly kicks Krillin, sending him flying and knocking him unconscious.
"
A Reversal,383 (DBZ 189),"The cover of this chapter shows Cell's final three forms standing in a line.
 Krillin lays near-dead on the rocky ground of the island, after Cell had performed a light, but devastating kick upon Krillin's head. Future Trunks in complete concern rushes to save his comrade with a Senzu Bean, as the confused Android 16, the arrogant Vegeta, and Cell watch. Vegeta descends toward the ground, and begins to taunt Cell, wondering if Cell takes pleasure in defeating people far weaker than himself, also questioning even if Cell's transformation into completion has even boosted his power at all. Cell grins quietly, until apologizing if he had disappointed Vegeta in his expectation, and asks Vegeta if he will care to help him warm up. Vegeta laughs, and promises to make sure the fight ends before Cell even attacks. As Future Trunks notices Krillin coming back to full health after swallowing the Senzu Bean, Krillin warns Future Trunks that Vegeta stands no chance against Cell, and that he will easily be slaughtered. Cell and Vegeta perform their signature poses and prepare to start the second round.
 As Future Trunks questions how Krillin knows this, Krillin explains that while he may not be nearly as strong as a Saiyan, he can sense exactly how strong someone is, and states Cell's kick was nothing more than a light tap. Krillin also exclaims that Cell is hiding much of its power, and he will not need to use it all in his fight. As Future Trunks looks in concern, Krillin also states he knows Future Trunks is hiding massive power himself, perhaps by breaking a barrier of Super Saiyan that Vegeta could not reach. Vegeta and Cell finally begin round two of their struggle, as Vegeta starts by attempting to perform a heavy kick, which Cell manages to block with his hands. Vegeta attempts to retaliate with an elbow attack, but Cell manages to block that too with his right forearm.
 Back with Future Trunks and Krillin, Future Trunks explains that while both he and Vegeta surpassed the regular Super Saiyan form in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Future Trunks went one step further which Vegeta did not notice. Future Trunks also states he could never tell his father of this, as the information would turn Vegeta into madness, knowing he has been surpassed once again.
 As Vegeta and Cell continue, Cell performs a light arm attack which Vegeta manages to block, until the two jump from each other and stand quietly. Android 16 assumes Cell may have gotten stronger, but Vegeta still has the upperhand, until Vegeta states Cell is not taking the fight seriously, as Cell replies that he is only ""warming up"". As this information shocks Android 16, Vegeta orders Cell to fight properly, stating he will probably want revenge for his brutal beating earlier on while in his second form. Cell agrees, and zooms towards Vegeta far too fast for Vegeta to notice. As Cell emerges behind Vegeta, Vegeta changes all of his power and performs an amazing kick directly on the side of Cell's head. However, there is absolutely no visible damage, as Cell grins while Vegeta gasps in complete terror. Cell chuckles at Vegeta's attempt to destroy him, as Krillin orders Future Trunks to help his father with his latent power. Future Trunks reluctantly states Vegeta would rather be brutally broken than be saved in battle, so Future Trunks decides to stay put until Vegeta is defeated. With the fight seemingly hopeless for Vegeta, Cell stand confidently, as the fate of the Earth continues, in this desperate struggle.
"
The Final Flash,384 (DBZ 190),"The cover of this chapter shows Goku and Gohan in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.
 Vegeta prepares the Final Flash While Vegeta is pummeled by Cell, Krillin asks Future Trunks why he didn't step in to help him. Future Trunks tells that he will help, but only after Vegeta is knocked out, telling he is stronger than his dad but does not want to show this to his father. Android 16 briefly tries to step in and help, but Cell warns him what will happen. Suddenly, Vegeta decides to try out a new attack, his Final Flash. Vegeta challenges Cell to take on the attack, and Cell accepts. Future Trunks immediately tries to convince his dad otherwise, but Vegeta still proceeds. Krillin realizing the power of the blast, yells at Trunks to get back . As the attack reaches Cell, he realizes too late its power. Vegeta manages to get it to only hit Cell and avoids blowing up the Earth, at the expense of not killing Cell. Vegeta is left confident of his abilities.
"
Trunks Steps In,385 (DBZ 191),"The cover of this chapter shows Vegeta running up to Perfect Cell while Future Trunks and Krillin float watching in the background.
 Cell continues to scream in pain, having just had his arm and a chunk of his body blown off by Vegeta's Final Flash. Vegeta laughs at his success, and Krillin and Trunks are relieved that he managed to pull it off. However, Cell soon stops screaming and smirks, reminding Vegeta that he has Piccolo's cells, and proceeds to regenerate his body and arm. Cell then walks towards Vegeta, ready to shut him up for good.
 In desperation, Vegeta fires a barrage of Ki Blasts, but Cell unflinchingly walks through them and sends Vegeta flying with a punch. Vegeta struggles to his feet, only for Cell to kick him into the air, then follow up with an elbow smash to his back, driving him into the ground and knocking him unconscious.
 Cell prepares to put Vegeta out of his misery, but Krillin yells at Trunks that now's the time to step in. Trunks begins powering up, transforming into his Super Saiyan Third Grade form.
"
Trunks Surpasses His Father!,386 (DBZ 192),"超トランクス！ The cover of this chapter shows various characters and writing all inside little square panels. The characters include Krillin, Cell, Gohan, Master Roshi, Yamcha  ,Piccolo, Vegeta, Future Trunks, Android 16, Bulma, Goku, and Tien Shinhan. This cover art is similar the covers of the chapters ""Let the Games Begin!"" and ""The Mysterious Strangers"", and is also featured in Daizenshuu 1.
 Super Trunks faces Perfect Cell Future Trunks continues powering up into his Super Saiyan Third Grade form, which distracts Cell's attention from finishing off Vegeta. Both Cell and Krillin are amazed at how powerful Trunks has become now. Trunks gives Krillin a Senzu Bean and tells him to get Vegeta away from the fighting. He then descends to face Cell, who's impressed by how much power Trunks had buried in him.
 Trunks claims that he's going to kill Cell, to which Cell remarks that's a bold statement. They walk up to and face each other, then Cell opens with a kick, which Trunks dodges. He then jumps up for a punch, which Cell dodges and counters with a punch of his own. Cell then kicks Trunks away, much to Krillin's shock. But then Trunks points him towards Vegeta, revealing he's playing possum to lure Cell away from Vegeta.
 Cell continues the attack on Trunks, but Krillin takes advantage of the opportunity to grab Vegeta and fly him to safety. With Vegeta out of harm's way, Cell asks if Trunks can now fight freely. Trunks is surprised that Cell just let him go, but Cell is now more interested in Trunks' power, which Trunks is more than wiling to share. Trunks powers up again, ready to fight for real.
"
The Balance of Power,387 (DBZ 193),"The cover shows Goku in thought on the porch of the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, with Gohan watching from a distance.
 Future Trunks continues to push up his power, planning on showing his true power to Cell. Cell is certainly impressed by Trunks' magnificent power, even greater than his own, but assures Thunks that power isn't everything. Trunks calls Cell's statement a bluff and charges.
 Up on The Lookout, Piccolo is in utter shock at just how powerful Trunks is. Bulma yells at Piccolo to tell her what's going on, and Piccolo says he's talking about Trunks, much to Bulma's delight.
 Inside the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Gohan transforms into a Super Saiyan and flies around, throwing punches and kicks at the air. Goku, who is meditating nearby, is impressed with how fast Gohan has progressed. Gohan, in the meantime, is wondering why his dad has just been sitting there for so long. Gohan throws a few more kicks, then drops to the ground, reverting to his base form and gasping for air.
 Goku then stands up, transforming into a Super Saiyan himself. He then begins to push himself harder, transforming into a Super Saiyan Second Grade. Gohan is amazed that Goku managed to surpass the Super Saiyan state, but Goku thinks he can push it even further, transforming into a Super Saiyan Third Grade. Gohan is really impressed by Goku's power, believing he can defeat Cell easily now.
 However, back at the fight, one of the weaknesses of the Super Saiyan Third Grade form is being shown. For all his power, try as he might, Trunks can't manage to land a single blow on Cell, who is dodging all of Trunks' attacks with ease.
 And Goku realizes this. He figures out that the Super Saiyan Third Grade form takes up too much energy and kills his speed, saying that all the power won't do any good if you can't hit who you're fighting. Goku comes up with a new plan, for him and Gohan to instead focus on mastering the basic Super Saiyan form.
 Meanwhile, Trunks is baffled, wondering why he can't hit Cell despite all his power. Cell mocks him for relying only on brute force, then transforms into the Super Saiyan Third Grade form himself, revealing that anyone can take on such a form.
"
Cell's Idea,388 (DBZ 194),"The cover depicts Cell, in his Perfect Form, holding up a finger.
 Cell has just transformed into a Power Stressed form of his own, and calls Future Trunks an idiot for using a transformation that only gives brute strength. Trunks realizes this is why Vegeta never took on the Super Saiyan Third Grade form, and that Cell's right. Trunks reverts to his base form and tells Cell to kill him, since he has no chance now.
 On an island far away, Krillin realizes that Trunks' ki has shrunk, but that Cell's is still huge. He quickly feeds Vegeta the Senzu Bean so they can get back to help. Meanwhile, Cell is about to kill Trunks for both him and Vegeta being such disappointments.
 Up on The Lookout, Piccolo realizes just how powerful Perfect Cell is, and states that Trunks is about to die. However, Cell is impressed that Vegeta and Trunks had improved so significantly in a short amount of time, and asks if they had even more time, they could get even stronger. Trunks replies that he won't know until he tries. Cell then asks what Goku is doing, and Trunks answers that he's training to defeat Cell.
 Cell is pleased by this answer, and announces that he plans to hold a tournament in ten days. He challenges Trunks to gather allies and get stronger so they can compete against him. Trunks is confused, wondering what Cell's goal is now. Cell states that it was formerly to kill Goku, but now it's just to have fun by causing utter terror for the world. Cell voices eagerness to see the look of fear and terror on the people's face's. Trunks is horrifed, as Cell announces that's the look. Cell then flies away just as Krillin and Vegeta arrive.
 Back on the Lookout, Bulma is yelling at Piccolo to go save Trunks, but Piccolo reveals that Trunks is all right. Piccolo, however, realizes that now he'll have to do some training of his own in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.
 Back on the Islands, Trunks has told Krillin and Vegeta about Cell's plans, which annoys Vegeta, thinking Cell is toying with them. However, Trunks and Vegeta are willing to train more for the tournament. At that moment, the damaged Android 16 arrives, wanting to compete in the tournament as well, but first asks to be taken to Capsule Corporation so he can get needed repairs. Trunks doesn't want the Android's help, but Krillin agrees to take the android, knowing they'll need all the help they can get against Cell, and that these androids aren't as bad as the ones from Trunks' future.
 The next day would come the broadcast that would terrorize the world...
"
Message of Terror,389 (DBZ 195),"The cover depicts the opening scene of the chapter, with Cell arriving at the perfect spot for the Cell Games.
 Cell has arrived at the perfect spot for the Cell Games Tournament. He proceeds to clear out a chunk of ground, making it slightly larger than the ring for the World Martial Arts Tournament. He then proceeds to slice up a rock into smooth stone, which he then uses to build the floor of the ring. With the ring set up, and deciding to add decorations later, Cell heads off for the ZTV station to make his announcement.
 At Kame House, Yamcha and Krillin are near the TV, which is currently showing a weather report. However, screams from the TV get their attention, and they see that Cell has arrived at the TV Station. Cell proceeds to tell the world about the upcoming Cell Games tournament, and challenges all of the world's greatest fighters to compete against him. If they lose, he will kill every single human on Earth before completely destroying the planet. To show that he's not bluffing, Cell proceeds to blow a massive hole in the wall of the ZTV Station, then flies out.
 Master Roshi, Krillin and Yamcha wonder just who could stand a chance against Cell. Vegeta, however, announces that he's going to train in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber again, at which Future Trunks announces he's going too. Bulma wants to give Trunks a haircut first, so that his long hair doesn't get in his eyes.
 Cell's broadcast has filled the world with fear, the civilians having no faith in the army or their champions. However, they had forgotten about a little boy, who, long ago, had slain the tyrannical King Piccolo and, more recently, turned aside the threat of the invading Saiyans, as well as the galactic emperor Frieza. The world had forgotten Goku, who, at that very moment, was training hard with his son.
"
The Emergence,390 (DBZ 196),"The cover features Perfect Cell standing on a globe.
 Everyone on The Lookout is expecting for Goku and Gohan to emerge from the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. With their Battle Armor all tattered and damaged, Goku and Gohan emerge out as Super Saiyans, to everyone's surprise. Goku asks Mr. Popo whether the cloths he left is there, and Mr. Popo says yes and gets the Gi. Gohan asks Piccolo for clothes like Piccolo himself, so Piccolo uses his Magic Materialization to change Gohan's clothes. As Vegeta asks whether Goku can beat Cell, Goku asks how strong Cell is and the current situation as he does not know how Cell he reached his Perfect form. Using Instant Transmission, Goku goes to the Cell Games Arena. Goku and Cell enter a stand off, and Cell declares that here will be the fate of the universe. Goku declares that he will be the first to fight Cell in the ring so he leaves all the others out of this. Goku says that Cell is not the first person who has tried to rule the universe by his evil ways, and then he returns to the lookout. There, Future Trunks asks whether Goku can beat Cell, and Goku says he does not stand a chance right now. Piccolo advises Goku and Gohan to use the Hyperbolic Time Chamber again, but Goku declines, to Piccolo's surprise.
"
The Calm Before the Storm,391 (DBZ 197),"The cover shows Gohan and Goku as Super Saiyan Full Power, next to each other, with Goku encouraging Gohan. This chapter's cover illustration appears as a picture shown during the ending credits of Dragon Ball Z: Bojack Unbound.
 Piccolo asks why Goku would not go back in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, and Goku says he would not get anywhere in there since it is too harsh on the body; getting plenty of rest will be better. Vegeta thinks the Hyperbolic Time Chamber was too rough for even the great ""Kakarot"". Goku says all that pointless work on the body is just painful, not training. But he has no problem if they want to go in there, there is still room for them to work in there. Vegeta does not like how Kakarot is talking like his strength is greater than Vegeta's. Goku says it is much greater, and Vegeta freaks out. Goku wishes them all good luck, and says they will meet again at the Cell Games. He flies off, and Gohan follows. On their way down toward the bottom of Earth, Goku says they will make a quick stop, and they drop in on Korin Tower.
 They say hello to Korin and Yajirobe. Yajirobe says he is not entering that tournament no matter what, and Goku says that is not why he came. Karin says terrible things are happening to the Earth, and Goku says Cell is even more incredible now that he has reached his perfect form. Karin thinks Goku looks really calm even so, and asks if he discovered something wonderful in the Room of Spirit and Time. Goku kind of laughs it off, and Gohan wonders if he really did discover something as he was with him the whole time. Goku asks Karin if he knows how strong Cell is, and Karin says not really, but he could estimate it. Goku asks him to try and compare Cell's power to his own, he will raise his ki.
 Tien Shinhan wonders if Goku and Gohan were really Super Saiyans, since they seemed so natural. Piccolo says they definitely were, but they seem to be training by staying at an ordinary everyday level. Future Trunks thinks it must be so they could do an even more incredible transformation when it is time to battle, but Vegeta says no. Vegeta explains that they have deduced that that state is best, because if they get accustomed to it, then they can up their battle power with little strain to the body. Then all of a sudden, at Karin's place, Goku starts to power up. He nearly blows Karin and Yajirobe away, and Karin yells at him to stop. The others at The Lookout feel Goku's ki, and can not believe it.
 Goku tells Karin this is half his power, and Karin thinks it is crazy to be that strong. Gohan thinks ""So this is how amazing father has gotten..."" Now Goku asks him to compare him to Cell. Karin gets silent, and then says this is just a guess, but Cell is a bit greater. Goku realizes his own estimation was correct, and thanks Karin. He touches Gohan on the shoulder and the two teleport away. Yajirobe thinks Goku is not human anymore, while Karin wonders why Goku is so calm. Elsewhere, Vegeta is frustrated at Kakarot for always being one step ahead of him, and yells at Piccolo to hurry up and go in the room.
 Goku and Gohan arrive at Kame House, and Goku says they will get Chi-Chi and go home. There, they will have three days of rest, three days of training, and then another three days of rest. Gohan wonders if all this is really good and Goku says to just go get his mom. Chi-Chi screams when she sees Gohan's hair color, thinking he is turned into a delinquent. There are nine days until the Cell Games.
"
Cell vs. the Army,392 (DBZ 198),"
 
 In this chapter, the cover has landscape orientation instead of portrait. It shows Super Saiyan Full Power Goku and Gohan unpacking a car for a picnic with Chi Chi.
 Goku, Gohan, and Chi-Chi are having a picnic next to a lake, and Goku points out a huge fish in the lake. Gohan asks if it is okay to be this carefree, and Goku tells him not to worry, it will probably all work out. Gohan does not like the ""probably"", but Goku assures him they can win, so there is no point in training anymore. Chi-Chi tells them their lunch is ready, so they go to eat. Some time passes, and then they are driving down a road. Goku says that all the shops are closed, and Chi-Chi says it is because they think they all are going to die in seven days, so they are not working. Then a newsman comes on over the radio, and Goku says there is someone working. The newsman says the Royal Army is on its way to 28 KS Point 5 to attack the monster called Cell. Goku yells at them to stop, since they will just be killed.
 A bunch of tanks, planes, and soldiers approach Cell's ring, and the foolish army has arrived. Cell flies out of the ring, and someone says he is getting away. Cell lands on a nearby mountain, thinking he just does not want his ring to get destroyed given all the work he put into making it. Someone yells not to let him get away, and to start the offensive. A bunch of tanks and missiles are fired at Cell, and Goku's family is listening to the play-by-play on the radio. The commander calls for the attacks to cease, as they have done enough. But, when the smoke clears, Cell is completely unscathed. Everyone tries to retreat, but Cell just waves his hand and completely destroys the army. Cell thinks that was a waste of time, as Goku turns off the radio. Goku tells Chi-Chi and Gohan to go home, he has business with Piccolo. He then steps out of the car and teleports away.
 When Goku arrives at The Lookout, the first thing he asks is if Piccolo has been in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber too (Vegeta must be in there now), since his level has gone way up. Piccolo says that he has, but he doubts he is any match for Cell and Goku affirms it. Piccolo smirks and says he is really blunt, and then asks why he came here. Goku asks Piccolo if he and Kami can split again now that they have reunited, since he wants to return all the people that Cell killed back to life. Piccolo says no, once merged they can never be separate entities again otherwise they wouldn't had hesitated on the merger. Goku had figured out, and then says he wants to find the planet the surviving Namekians went to. Surely someone there would be willing to come to Earth. Then they would have another Guardian, and the Dragon Balls would be restored.
"
The New Kami-sama,393 (DBZ 199),"The cover shows a scene from the manga, the Dragon Team on the Lookout.
 Goku says he will go search for the Namekians now, and Mr. Popo says he would also be happy to have a new Guardian. Piccolo asks Goku how he will get there though, since they do not know what planet they went to, and their time is limited. Goku says he has Instant Transmission, and he will just search for people with a ki like Piccolo's. Piccolo asks if he can really seek out ki that far away, and Goku thinks so. Goku searches, but then says he can not after all. Goku wonders if he could find them from King Kai's Planet, though, and teleports away. Meanwhile, everyone at Kame House is watching TV, and King Furry is coming on. ""As we broadcasted sometime ago, the army, who concentrated all of its effort, was hit with a destructive attack from Cell. I take full responsibility. That was truly inexcusable; it was not the way to go. Honestly, I do not know what more we can do. However, please do not get into any kind of panic. I believe that a savior, like the boy who defeated King Piccolo long ago, will appear once more! Let us pray, to God."" Krillin notes that God is gone.
 Goku has arrived at Kaio's planet, and he says hello to Bubbles. Then he goes to King Kai, who was sleeping on a lounge chair. Kaio asks why he came here, and Goku realizes he does not know all the incredible stuff that is happening to the Earth. Kaio says the region he rules over is vast, and he can not just watch the Earth. Goku brings up how he was napping in spite of this, and Kaio yells at him to just tell him what is going on. Goku says ""Well..."" and Kaio freaks out. Goku says he has not said anything yet, and Kaio says ""Oh yeah. Hurry up and talk."" So, Goku explains everything and ends with how he needs to find the planet where the Namekians are. Kaio takes this all in, saying crazy things are always happening to Goku, one after the other. Goku says it would really help if he would point him in the direction of the Namekians new planet.
 Kaio sits still and concentrates, while Goku tells him how Mister Popo is lonely and everything. Kaio yells at him to be quiet so he can concentrate. Goku holds his hands over his mouth, until Kaio finds them. He points in the direction and Goku concentrates, facing in that direction. Kaio realizes he has learned Instant Transmission from the people of Yardrat, and says what a useful technique it is. This time Goku tells Kaio to be quiet. Then Goku finds it, and teleports away. He arrives on the new Planet Namek. The Namekians surprised to see him, while Goku says there are lots of Piccolos. Muri asks who he is, and Goku says he is called Son Goku and he is from Earth. Muri gets excited, knowing that he was the one who fought Frieza and rescued them. Goku nervously says yeah, but Namek exploded.
 Goku finishes explaining everything to them, and how he needs someone to come to Earth and be their new God. Muri says there is someone here who would do that, and calls Dende over. Dende comes up to them, and Muri says how he is always saying he wants to go to Earth and hang out with Gohan and Krillin. Goku wants to know if he can make Dragon Balls though, and Muri says he has an excellent member of the Dragon Clan. Goku thinks that is great, and says hello to Dende. Goku thanks them all, and Dende says goodbye to everyone. Then they teleport back to Kaio, just to say it went well, and then straight to Kami's Lookout on Earth. Piccolo is surprised to see Dende, and Goku tells Dende to wait here while he goes and gets Krillin and Gohan.
 Krillin happens to be watching TV at Kame House with Yamcha. A reporter says the world fighting champion and superhero Mr. Satan will be appearing at the Cell Games. The reporter asks Mister Satan if he will be alright, since Cell did wipe out the King's army. Satan says that was just a trick involving explosive powder, and calls Cell an amateur. He goes on to threaten to beat up that crazy, and the crowd cheers for him. Krillin and Yamcha are unenthused, though. Goku arrives and asks Krillin to come with him. He is brought the new God, his name is Dende. Then Goku arrives at God's Palace, and Dende, Krillin, and Gohan are all excited to see each other. Future Trunks wants to ask Goku one thing: the reason he is so calm now is because he has found a weak point in Cell, right? But Goku does not think Cell has a weak point.
"
The Cell Game Begins!,394 (DBZ 200),"The cover depicts Cell waiting in the Cell Games Arena.
 Piccolo asks Dende if he's certain he can make Dragon Balls, but Goku says the guy on New Namek vouches for him. Dende says he could make Dragon Balls in 100 days, to Goku's shock, not realizing it would take that long. However, Dende adds that he could make them right away by reactivating the Dragon Balls of Earth, improving them so they grant three wishes, like the Namekian Dragon Balls. Piccolo asks if it's possible to make it so they can revive more than one person with a single wish, and Dende confirms this, though doing so means they only get two wishes.
 Piccolo says this is acceptable, and then asks Mr. Popo to bring his model of Shenron. Dende proceeds to restore life to the dragon, and reactivates the Dragon Balls. Goku tells Gohan to stay with Dende, and that he doesn't have to train anymore until the Cell Games. Gohan is surprised, but Goku reassures him before teleporting away. Future Trunks asks Gohan what Goku's thinking, and why he's so cheerful knowing that Cell is stronger than him. Gohan doesn't know what's going on either. Krillin thinks Goku has a plan, but Piccolo suggests he's just being fatalistic.
 Everyone passes the time until the Cell Games in their own way. Bulma and Dr. Brief work on repairing Android 16, Goku goes on a hunt for the newly revived Dragon Balls, Vegeta and Trunks continue their training, Cell waits in his arena, thinking ten days was too long, and Mr. Satan becomes famous as the hero about to face Cell.
 Finally, the day of the Cell Games arrives. Goku suits up in his gi, ready to go. Chi-Chi asks Goku to not get killed, and to make sure that Gohan's not fighting. Instead of assuring her that he won't let Gohan fight, however, Goku gets going instead, which confirms the truth for Chi-Chi.
 Goku arrives at the lookout, to find that Vegeta already left. Krillin then reveals a problem with the new Dragon Balls; even with the upgrade by Dende, the Earth Dragon Balls still can't revive anyone who's already died once. Goku, however, just says all they have to do is not die, then they head off for the Cell Games.
 Cell is waiting with anticipation for his chance to finally face Goku in battle. On a ridge a ways away, a ZTV Cameraman is recording the scene below, and Jimmy Firecracker is reporting that the Cell Games are about to begin. Eventually, Hercule's car arrives, and Hercule steps out, posing for the camera, then directing a thumbs down towards Cell. Cell is unimpressed. Jimmy Firecracker then announces that there's only fifteen minutes until the Cell Games begin.
"
Heroes Assemble!,395 (DBZ 201),"The covers shows Mr. Satan as the ""champion of the Earth"".
 With twelve minutes before the start, Satan is already climbing into the ring. Satan calls the the announcer and cameraman over, and so they go, with the announcer calling himself the world's bravest announcer. They both climb up too, to interview Satan. Satan says he is going to expose Cell. He knows that it was just a trick involving bombs when Cell destroyed Central City and the King's army. Cell ignores them, and Satan thinks he is just scared into shock. The announcer gives Cell the finger, while Satan bends over and spanks himself. Master Roshi is watching, and thinks it would not be so bad if this guy was killed. Then the announcer and Satan notice someone flying in. Cell says Vegeta has arrived, and his skills have gone up. The announcer wonders if he was really flying, but Satan says it was a trick. The announcer goes over to talk to Vegeta, asking who he is and that it is dangerous here. The announcer goes back to Satan, saying he thinks that person is a bit crazy. Even his hair style is weird. Now there are just five minutes until the start of the Cell Games. Android 16 arrives next, with a Capsule Corporation patch over his Red Ribbon Army logo, and Cell is surprised to see him. Vegeta says only Bulma and her father could have repaired that robot, but they wasted their time.
 Then Cell says Goku has finally arrived. Seven of them fly in and land; Gohan, Krillin, Piccolo, Yamcha, Goku, Tien Shinhan, and Future Trunks. The announcer says they were all flying, but Satan insists it was just a trick. No. 16 walks over to Kuririn, and thanks him for getting him fixed like this. Goku wishes No. 16 good luck, but No. 16 says ""I was created to kill you. Do not forget that, Son Goku."" Goku cracks his knuckles, and says he wants to go first. Vegeta does not care because either way he will be the one to finish off Cell. Satan says they do not get to decide the order, and the announcer asks if they intend on participating. Goku says yeah, most of us. The announcer yells that this is not a game, they do not know anything. Kuririn thinks they are the ones that do not know anything, while Satan thinks they are people who do not know about the world champion Mister Satan. The announcer goes on about Satan, and Kuririn asks Goku if it is okay for Satan to be first. Cell interrupts them, saying it is time to begin.
"
"Hercule, Champion of the World",396 (DBZ 202),"The Cover shows the Dragon Team, in preparation for the Cell Games.
 Cell tells someone to hurry up and get in the ring, and Mr. Satan insists he is going first, and nobody else will need to fight Cell. Goku warns Satan he will be killed, and he should stop, but Satan ignores him, while the announcer tells the cameraman to go over to the idiot over there. The reporter tells everybody on Earth what this person just said to the world champion Mister Satan, and people watching around the world think Goku is an idiot. At King Castle, King Furry is watching. The King thinks that man looks just like the boy who had saved the world from King Piccolo, but his hair and eye color are different, so it must not be him. However, someone else among them looks just like him, Piccolo.
 Krillin tells Goku not to worry, since they can just return Satan to life with the Dragon Balls, and Goku realizes it is no use trying to warn him. Goku waves at them that it is okay, and the announcer figures he realizes how great Satan is after all. Satan takes off his cape, then his Champion Belt, and stares down Cell for a bit. Then, he pulls out a capsule, pops it open, and out from it comes a big bag. He opens the bag, pulls out fifteen tiles, and he stacks all of them. Satan concentrates, and then chops through fourteen of them with his bare hand. Goku and everyone are silent, while Cell thinks he is a complete idiot. Satan tells him to look at those busted tiles, that will be him in one minute. Satan thinks this will be great for his popularity, with this even being recorded on video. Satan takes his stance, while the announcer goes on about the Cell Games starting, which will decide the fate of the world. Satan charges at Cell, and hits him in the face with his Dynamite Kick. He lets off a flurry of punches at Cell, until Cell finally swats him aside. Krillin whispers to Gohan that he was actually kind of rooting for Cell on this one. Satan crashes into a nearby mountain, but somehow he is still alive. Krillin looks disappointed. The world is shocked that Satan got a ring out, and Cell says they will hurry and start the Cell Games now, and Goku steps up. Satan says he is just taking a break, next time he will get serious. Vegeta can not believe Mr. Satan still does not realize how much greater Cell is than him.
"
Trunks The History - The Lone Warrior,Special,"The cover shows Future Trunks standing on some mountain rocks next to a destroyed city in the background as he watches in devastation on the ruined and destroyed cities caused by the Androids in his apocalyptic future and thinks about the many lives they have taken away.
 Gohan sparring with Trunks The chapter begins with Future Trunks as a young boy training with Future Gohan as a Super Saiyan. As Gohan blocks Trunks' furious flurry of punches, he calls it enough for one day, and Trunks powers down from Super Saiyan and has a talk with Gohan. As Gohan compliments Trunks on his improved skills, Trunks exclaims that it is a shame all the Senzu Beans have gone, now that Gohan is missing his left arm from an earlier battle with the terrible Future Android 17 and Future Android 18, who had killed all of Gohan's friends and Trunks' father after Goku had died from a Heart Virus. Gohan just replies to Trunks' remark by saying he's glad he's alive at all, and still able to fight. Trunks also comments how his mother Bulma said how startling it is seeing Gohan in his father's Gi, taking over his father's role as protector of the planet. 
 Suddenly without warning, there is an enormous explosion nearby, as Gohan and Trunks rush to their feet, preparing to defend the dying city. As Gohan angrily states he has had enough of the Androids' sadistic crimes, he transforms into a Super Saiyan, and prepares to fly off. Trunks however, stops him, saying he wants to go fight too, as he's become a lot stronger. Gohan however, refuses, and knocks Trunks out-cold, and leaves him on the rocky landscape, stating that if he died too, there would be nobody left to stop the Androids. 
 In the city, Future Android 17 continues to blast every building into rubble, as the bored 18 suggests they should head out north, where many humans are still hiding. 17 suggests otherwise, stating it'll be over far too quickly, and they'll have no fun quite quickly, leaving nothing left. 18 suggests they play the game they did earlier and ""run them down with cars again."" As 18 decimates a man behind her, Gohan performs a swift attack and kicks 17 directly on the head, knocking him into the rubble. As 17 emerges unharmed from the rubble, 18 laughs at his ruined outfit, while 17 complains he liked his outfit, and it is hard to find good clothing. As 17 compliments Gohan for surviving their last encounter over a year ago with only one arm, Gohan states he will destroy the Androids, as his power has greatly risen since their last fight. 17 however, admits that he'd only been using just below half his power during their last fight, news which shocks Gohan, as hope begins to leave him. 17 rushes forward towards his target, as 18 begins to laugh. 
 Hours later, Trunks wakes from unconsciousness, and wonders where Gohan is, preparing to search the destroyed city. As Trunks does not feel Gohan's Ki, he greatly worries for his only friend, eventually finding Gohan's body in a bloody mess. As Trunks screams in grief and sadness, he starts to shed tears for his fallen friend.
 Future Bulma watches her son leaving for the past Three years later, Trunks arrives back to his home carrying food supplies for him and his mother, as Bulma is working on a new invention; a Time Machine. Trunks however, believes himself to be stronger than the Androids now, information to which Bulma scolds him for, not wanting him to risk his life like that like Gohan did. As Trunks rushes from his door after hearing on the radio that the Androids are attacking 300 km south of West City, Trunks clips on his sword belt, and transforms, preparing to defeat the Androids once and for all. 
 However, five days later, Trunks is lying in bed in hospital, with his mother taking care of him. The two discuss Trunks' lucky escape, and Bulma's plan for Trunks when he goes back in time. Bulma asks for Trunks to give Goku a heart virus medicine, and hopefully with Goku still around, the Androids would be defeated. After Trunks recovers, he prepares to head off in the time machine, as his mother waves him goodbye.
 Several differences are made in the anime adaptation of Trunks: The Story into The History of Trunks:
"
Cell vs. Son Goku,397 (DBZ 203),"The cover shows Super Saiyan Full Power Goku and Perfect Cell standing in front of each other face to face ready to battle.
 Goku and Cell With Mr. Satan having been quickly knocked out of the ring, Goku steps into the Cell Games Arena to face Cell. The rest of the Dragon Team watch anxiously from the sidelines. Cell and Goku both crack their knuckles and stare each other down. Cell says that he had hoped to save the best for last, but there is nothing he can do. The two assume their fighting poses, and Future Trunks thinks that they will all finally see why Goku was so calm in the days before the tournament. Jimmy Firecracker reassures the rest of the Earth by saying that Mr. Satan merely lost his footing, and will fight Cell again soon.
 Firecracker continues by calling Goku an idiot, saying that only death can cure his stupidity. He asks for Mr. Satan's opinion, and Mr. Satan says that Goku is an amateur who would not last two seconds against him. He gives Goku five seconds against Cell, and he and Jimmy joke that this will not be much of a break for him. Goku and Cell then begin their fight. Goku attacks with a kick and a punch, both of which Cell blocks. The two trade a quick flurry of blows before moving apart. Cell then dashes head-first at Goku, and the Saiyan blocks his blow. Goku then falls backwards and kicks Cell into the sky before chasing after him.
 As he flies upwards towards Cell, Goku unleashes a Kamehameha, but Cell knocks the blow away. Goku quickly appears behind Cell and punches him in the back. An angered Cell turns and hits Goku in the face, then smashes him downwards. Goku recovers and lands in the arena, and Cell follows him down. Goku gets up and smiles, and Cell says that should do for a warm-up. Mr. Satan and Jimmy Firecracker stand near the arena watching the action, jaws dropped in amazement.
"
Full Power,398 (DBZ 204),"The cover features a panel in the left side of the cover showing Super Saiyan Goku powering up as he prepares to battle Cell while another panel in the upper right part of the cover shows Cell with a smirk on his face as he watches Goku powering up with Vegeta in the foreground, seen with an expression of shock and amazement as he watches Goku powering up.
 Goku and Cell, having completed their warm-up sparring, stand facing each other in the ring. Mr. Satan and Jimmy Firecracker are still amazed by what they have just seen. Krillin says that the real fight is about to start, and Jimmy says that Goku appears to have been pulling off some good moves. He asks Mr. Satan for his opinion on Goku. Feigning confidence, Mr. Satan says that Goku is better than he expected but must be pushing his limits. Meanwhile, Cell and Goku each think to themselves that the fight will be challenging. Goku decides to power up to his full power, and the increase of which shocks most of the Dragon Team. Gohan, however, does not seem impressed and wonders why the others are so amazed.
 As Mr. Satan and Jimmy recover from the shockwave caused by Goku's power increase, Cell decides to power up as well. Once again, the rest of the Dragon Team, Mr. Satan, and Jimmy are stunned by what happens, but Goku seems pleased. He and Cell approach each other in the center of the ring, and Cell tells him to do it. Goku agrees, and begins their true battle by punching Cell in the stomach, then elbowing him in the back. He follows this up with a kick and a punch to the face. Cell bounces off the ring but then freezes in midair, telling Goku that the attack was good. He says that a fight is no fun unless the opponents are well-matched, and Goku agrees.
"
The Highest Level,399 (DBZ 205),"The cover shows Super Saiyan Goku and Perfect Cell locking hands while battling each other.
 The Cell Game continues, the tournament that will ultimately decide the fate of mankind, and possibly the universe. Cell and Goku continue their high-altitude battle, each performing many tactics and energy attacks at high speed to leave all the Z Fighters, minus Gohan, in complete awe at their skills. After brawling non-stop for several minutes, Goku and Cell finally land back down in the Cell Games Arena, each preparing for their next maneuver. Mr. Satan (the martial arts champion set to fight Cell originally), and his reporter, look in astonishment. The reporter asks his cameraman if he managed to capture any of the battle, and the cameraman responds by stating they were so fast there would be no possible way to capture it on tape. Still in amazement, the reporter asks Mr. Satan what he thinks of this amazing battle between these titan warriors, and comments how fast they are. Mr. Satan replies, in an awkward grin, that they are not as bad as he had expected them to be, still in confusion as to what has happened so far.
 Still grinning in confidence, Cell rubs his cheek for any possibly blood remaining on his face, and makes a stance. Goku holds his ground, making a defensive pose for a possible strike. Cell then changes his stance, and starts to move his arms in a very familiar fashion that Goku has encountered many times before. Cell is charging up a Super Kamehameha, seemingly at full power. Goku, in astonishment, pleads to Cell not to fire the attack where it is, or else it will completely annihilate the planet. Cell continues to slowly charge the attack, despite Goku's warning. To avoid Cell damaging Earth, Goku leaps and flies upward in the air, where Cell aims for and fires the attack in a huge flash of light, as the Z Fighters, including Vegeta feel no hope of Goku making it out alive. As the beam heads closer and closer towards Goku, big enough to totally encompass Goku, Goku uses his signature technique Instant Transmission, to dodge the attack. Cell notices Goku disappear in a flash second, wondering what could have happened, as there would have been no way for him to outrun the attack. Goku, in the blink of an eye, reappears behind Cell, and kicks him directly on the back of its head, knocking Cell over, but Cell manages to avoid landing on its face, and backflips in recovery. Standing intimidatingly, Goku looks upon the surprised Cell, who's lip begins to bleed. Cell demands to know how Goku could have possibly avoiding the attack, also noting that he saw Goku similarly disappear about a week ago when Goku used Instant Transmission to save Piccolo and Tien Shinhan from Cell. Goku explains that he was taught the ability of teleportation, with Cell calling the technique a possible nuisance. Goku asks Cell if it would have still fired its Kamehameha even if he had not have jumped. Cell notes however, that he knew Goku would jump, as he would not possibly risk the planet's well-being to land one attack. Goku complements Cell for his tactics, and Cell however still states he could easily wipe the planet out if he felt like it, it'd just cost him a little entertainment from possible people he can fight or kill. Cell takes a new stance, suggesting he will charge directly towards Goku. Noticing this, Goku takes a defensive stance, as the battle continues once again. Cell's speed however, is too quick for Goku to block, as Cell manages to land one heavy elbow attack. Goku attempts to retaliate by attempting to perform a heavy punch, however, Cell manages to quickly, and swiftly evade this counter, Cell elbows Goku in the back of the head, making Goku land face down on the arena. Goku jumps back from the ground, while Cell swats Goku with the back of his hand, making Goku plummet once again back to the ground. His confidence higher than ever, Cell grins and complements Goku's skills of lasting this long, but still states Goku's skills do not compare to Cell's own, and that it will take more than teleportation to surpass Cell's speed. With hope seemingly dying for the Z Fighters to defeat Cell, Goku and Cell continue their desperate struggle, to finally bring an outcome to the brutal match, the match to decide the future of Earth.
"
Ring Out,400 (DBZ 206),"The cover shows Goku with Cell flying behind him.
 Cell delivers a hard punch to Goku's face, and then goes for another, but Goku ducks it and kicks Cell into the air. Goku teleports up in the air behind Cell, and strikes at him, but it was just an afterimage. The real Cell is behind Goku now, and he swats at him, but Goku just barely dodges. They float there mid-air, while Mr. Satan and Jimmy Firecracker wonder where they went, and Krillin is amazed at their speed. Cell says he did not think it would be this fun, and he would hate for it to end from a ring out. He says he will remove ring outs being a loss from the rules, since they have no need for it. Goku screams down at everyone to get away from the ring, as Cell points his hands down at the ring, preparing to destroy it.
 There is a giant boom, and just like that a big hole appears in the ground where the ring used to be. Everyone made it to safety though, with No. 16 having taken care of Satan and the others. He tells them to leave, they are in the way, but they will not listen. Cell and Goku both land on the ground, and Cell says now the whole ground will be their ring. And now, victory will be decided by either giving up, or death. Goku agrees they should get to it. Cell fires a blast, but Goku dodges it. Cell fires another, and Goku dodges again. Cell fires a whole bunch this time, and Goku does his best to dodge them all, then he takes to the air.
 Goku begins to power up a Kamehameha, but Cell says Goku would never fire one from there. ""If you do, the Earth itself will be in danger!!"" But Goku continues charging up his attack anyway. As the attack is nearly finished, Cell begins to look terrified, realizing Goku's actually going to fire the Kamehameha at him and the Earth.
"
Kamehameha Full Power,401 (DBZ 207),"The cover shows Goku is mid-air, aiming a Kamehameha at Cell.
 Goku is still mid-air, aiming down at Cell, and Piccolo wonders if he really intends to fire that Kamehameha. Krillin thinks he would not, since the Earth would get blown up, and Cell doubts it too. Goku does not halt, and Cell and Vegeta both realize he does intend to fire it. But then Goku suddenly teleports and appears right in front of Cell, and he fires the Kamehameha full on. Cell is blown away, and when the smoke clears, Cell's headless, armless body is laying on the ground. Yamcha gets really excited, but Future Trunks and Kuririn were not. Mr. Satan thinks he did fairly well. Goku thinks Cell still has a lot of ki left for being in that condition, and Kuririn yells that Cell will probably revive himself.
 Cell regenerates from Goku's Instant Kamehameha The remains of Cell hops back to its feet, then sprouts out a new head and arms and everything. The announcer and Satan freak out, while Goku realizes he can regenerate himself. Cell announces that he can regenerate ""just like Piccolo."" Goku did not think he could really win so easily, but at least now Cell's ki has dropped a lot. Cell notes that Goku's ki has also dropped a lot, and he is breathing hard. Cell advises Goku not to do anymore pointless attacks, so he does not use up his strength and make the fight boring. Goku agrees, and charges at Cell with a punch, but Cell dodges. Goku blocks a kick, but then takes a hit to the face.
"
Last Resort,402 (DBZ 208),"The cover shows Goku in the foreground, while the battleground is in a small box.
 Cell punches Goku, sending him crashing into a nearby mountain. Cell charges after him, as Goku bursts out of the rubble and fires a whole bunch of blasts. Cell puts up a huge barrier to stop them all, as people around the world watch on TV. An old couple says that looks like Chi-Chi's husband. Bulma is watching with Kame-sennin at Kame House, and she thinks Goku is doing great. Kame-sennin does not, though. ""Goku can not win... Not only that, but I can see that he is fighting while knowing this. I do not know what he has planned, but..."" The barrier is gone now, and Goku is panting really hard. Cell says Goku's strength looks to have gone down, and says he can have a Senzu Bean if he wants. That will make this an even greater fight.
 Future Trunks yells at Kuririn to do like he says and give Goku a senzu, then he will definitely win. Vegeta yells at Future Trunks to shut up, saying he has no Saiyan pride. Kakarot would probably rather die than win like that. Right now, he is not even fighting for the Earth's sake. Future Trunks asks what they are supposed to do, be quiet and watch. Cell asks Goku if he can not eat a senzu because of his pride, and that Goku's chances of winning have gone up a bit.
 Goku says nothing, then smirks, lands, and the aura around him disappears. ""I give up! This is a submission! I know your strength very well now! So I will stop."" Everyone is shocked, and the cameraman relays to Mr. Satan and Jimmy Firecracker that he said he was giving up. Cell asks Son Goku if he realizes what this means. If there is no one left to fight in the Cell Games, everyone on the Earth will die. Goku says there is still one left to fight him, but Cell says it is the same difference, Vegeta and Future Trunks are not even as strong as Goku is. The announcer tells Mr. Satan it is his turn again, and Satan freaks out. Satan suddenly ""gets"" a stomach cramp. Goku asks if it is okay for him to pick the next person to fight, and Cell realizes he is serious about giving in. Vegeta wonders what is going on, since there is nobody else who can win.
"
The Successor,403 (DBZ 209),"The cover shows a picture of Cell in the center. On each side of him are pictures of the faces of four Z Fighters: Vegeta, Android 16, Future Trunks, and Gohan on the left, and Tien Shinhan, Piccolo, Yamcha, and Krillin on the right.
 Having quit his match against Cell and requested to choose the next fighter, Goku says that the Cell Games will end with this next match. Goku says that after fighting Cell himself, he knows that this next challenger will be able to beat him. The Z Fighters wonder who Goku could possibly mean, and Cell demands that Goku name this great fighter who can outdo them both. Mr. Satan fears that Goku will call upon him. After a moment of suspense, Goku turns to the Z Fighters and calls Gohan to fight, stunning everyone else present. Piccolo angrily states that Goku is sending his own son to his death. The cameraman working with Jimmy Firecracker, hearing Gohan's name (which means rice), tells Jimmy they are discussing food. Firecracker wonders how they can take a lunch break at a time like this.
 As Goku flies over to the Z Fighters, Cell dismisses the idea of fighting Gohan. Goku tells his son that he can succeed, but Piccolo angrily tells Goku to come to his senses. Goku questions Gohan about the battle thus far, and Gohan states that while he could follow it, neither Goku nor Cell were fighting for real. Goku says that he was in fact fighting at full power, but that it only seemed like he was not trying due to Gohan's strength. Piccolo and Vegeta are aghast at what this means about Gohan's true abilities, with Vegeta believing that Gohan is lying. After Goku tells him to save the world so he can grow up and become a scientist, Gohan agrees to fight Cell, and flies out to the battlefield. Goku then gets a Senzu Bean from Krillin and, much to the chagrin of his companions, throws it to Cell. When Yamcha and Piccolo object, Goku claims that the fight would not be fair otherwise, as Cell is exhausted. Cell claims that Goku playing the hero will be his doom, and that he will not decline the bean. He eats the bean and, surprised by its rejuvenating ability, powers up. As Piccolo complains again about Goku's actions, Gohan decides to power up as well, and the magnitude of his energy stuns Cell and the Z Fighters.
"
"Let's Go, Gohan!",404 (DBZ 210),"The cover is colored and shows Gohan as a Super Saiyan in foreground with three other boxes showing him at different stages of his life. This cover art is also featured in Daizenshuu 1.
 Everyone is shocked at Gohan's power, except Goku. Cell says Son Goku was right about Gohan being strong, but he was exaggerating to say he could beat Cell—a miscalculation that Cell proclaims will cost Gohan his life. Cell lands, and turns his attention to Gohan. He kicks at Gohan, but Gohan blocks it. Cell backs off, then charges at Gohan, but Gohan jumps out of the way. Cell turns to follow him and goes for a kick, but Gohan dodges. They both land, and then Cell grabs Gohan by the shirt and headbutts him hard. Then he hits Gohan in the face, before throwing him into the air. Cell uses a shockwave to send Gohan flying through some mountains. Krillin and Future Trunks are worried; Chi-Chi, watching at home on TV with Ox-King, faints.
 The announcer exclaims that a boy tragically lost his life after challenging Cell, right when everyone was supposed to break for lunch. Piccolo blames this all on Goku and his naiveté, saying he is the one who killed Gohan. Goku tells him to calm down, and to notice Gohan's ki did not drop at all. Cell says that the games are over, now he wants Son Goku to eat a Senzu Bean and come back to fight again. But Goku tells Cell to look behind him. Cell turns around, and Gohan is walking out of the rubble, barely damaged at all. Cell is very surprised to see him. Gohan tries to convince Cell not to fight, saying that the fight has no point. Cell laughs, and says the Cell Games has plenty of meaning: for him, it is amusement, for them, it is to save the Earth. Gohan responds that he just does not like to fight or kill.
 Krillin and the others can not hear what Gohan is saying. Cell says he knew Gohan does not like fighting, but had no idea Gohan did not want to kill him. He says Gohan could not kill him in a hundred years. Gohan says that he thinks the reason his dad thinks he can kill Cell is due to the way he goes berserk upon getting angry. Cell thinks Gohan said all that to try to scare him, but instead, he is going to try to make Gohan angry. He then proceeds to punch Gohan in the face.
"
The Rage of Son Gohan?,405 (DBZ 211),"The cover shows a screaming Gohan in the foreground, with a grinning Cell to the left and the watching Dragon Team to the right.
 Having punched Gohan in the face, Cell follows up with an elbow to the back of the head, followed by a kick which sends Gohan flying. Cell charges after him and attacks with a punch, but Gohan dodges and kicks Cell in the face, knocking him to the ground. Cell rises to his feet, and has a small amount of blood dripping from the left side of his mouth. He wipes the blood away with his thumb and smiles, saying he will unleash Gohan's rage one way or another. As he watches from the overlooking cliff, Goku is eager for Cell to unlock Gohan's anger. Cell then attacks Gohan with a series of Death Beams, which the young warrior nimbly dodges. Krillin recognizes the move as belonging to Frieza. After using his last Death Beam as a distraction, Cell dashes towards Gohan and traps him in a bear hug.
 Cell proceeds to squeeze Gohan tightly, taunting him in an effort to unlock his rage. Piccolo, watching with Goku, is overcome with anger and decides to help Gohan. Goku urges him to wait, and Piccolo asks for what. Goku says that they must wait for Gohan to get mad, as the power inside him is their only hope to defeat Cell. The rest of the Z Fighters are skeptical. As Cell continues to torment Gohan, Piccolo asks Goku if he discussed this plan with Gohan first. Goku has no response, and Piccolo continues to say that all Gohan is wondering is why his father will not help him. He vows to go aid Gohan, even if it costs him his life. Goku, swayed by Piccolo's words, asks Krillin for a Senzu Bean. Just then, however, Cell drops Gohan to the ground. Noting that his own pain seemingly will not get him angry, Cell promises to enlist the help of the Z Fighters instead. As Cell flies off towards the rest of the group, Gohan screams for him to stop.
"
#16's Secret Weapon,406 (DBZ 212),"
 
 The cover of this chapter shows Goku, Chi-Chi and a young Gohan in a vehicle.
 As Gohan screams for him to stop, Cell flies over to the Dragon Team and swiftly swipes the bag of Senzu Beans from Krillin's hands. He says that the beans are annoying, and flies back to the battlefield. He says that the rest of the Z Fighters are not worth dirtying his own hands on. Gohan asks what he is up to, and Cell says that he will do anything to unlock Gohan's rage. Gohan says that he cannot control it himself, and Cell says that this is why his friends must suffer. As Goku rues not taking a Senzu Bean while he had the chance, Gohan charges at Cell. Cell kicks him into some nearby rubble and yells at him to get mad for real.
 Just then, Android 16 unexpectedly flies in, capturing Cell in a bear hug. Piccolo notes that his lack of ki let him get in undetected. 16 asks them to forgive him for sacrificing them, and that he will blow himself up along with Cell. Krillin remembers the bomb inside of 16 that Bulma and her father removed. 16 says that none of them will survive the blast at close range, and attempts to detonate himself. However, the attempt fails, and when 16 asks why, Krillin informs him that the bomb was removed because it was too dangerous. Cell sarcastically says that this is too bad, but that no bomb blast would have killed him anyways. He then turns and rips 16 apart with a Ki Blast. Cell says that 16 was one of Dr. Gero's failures, and kicks his severed head away.
 Looking at the Z Fighters, Cell says that it is now their turn, and counts that there are seven of them. As Vegeta wonders what he is up to, Cell pops seven miniature copies of himself from his tail. Calling them Cell Juniors, he tells them to attack the Z Fighters, and that he does not care if they kill them. As the Cell Juniors head towards the Z Fighters, Cell says that they cannot win; even though the Cell Juniors are small, they are his children.
"
The Little Cells,407 (DBZ 213),"The cover depicts the seven Cell Juniors in a variety of poses.
 Z Fighters vs. Cell Juniors (colored version) Cell has just spawned an squadron of Cell Juniors and has sent them to attack the other Z Fighters in a bid to enrage Gohan to the point of revealing his true power. The Cell Juniors go on the attack, and quickly prove to have the advantage over the other Z-Fighters. Krillin, Yamcha, and Tien Shinhan are quickly overwhelmed, Vegeta and Future Trunks are only holding their own, and Goku, still weakened from his fight with Cell, is getting overwhelmed as well.
 Gohan knows that everyone except Trunks has died before, so the Dragon Balls can't bring them back to life. This causes his anger to flare up a little, giving him a power boost that Cell notices. The devastation of the Z-Fighters continues, as Yamcha gets his arm broken and even Vegeta is starting to have trouble. Gohan wants to help, but doesn't know how to use his rage.
 Jimmy Firecracker and Mr. Satan are watching this while hiding behind a rock, and Jimmy suggests they get out while they still can. However, the disembodied head of Android 16 speaks up, pleading with them to take him to Gohan before they leave. At first, Hercule is reluctant, but Android 16 asks if he's the World Champion for real. Jimmy yells that he's a human champion, and this is a battle of freaks. However, Hercule manages to find a bit of courage and agrees to do it, saying that if he ran away while a bunch of no-names were out there fighting, he'd be a laughingstock.
 Hercule snatches up Android 16's head and runs with it, still scared. But Android 16 assures him that he only has to get close enough to throw him. While this is going on, the beatdown by the Cell Juniors continues, with Gohan now pleading with Cell to stop this. Cell realizes Gohan's close to his breaking point, so he orders the Cell Juniors to stop fooling around and kill the others, pushing Gohan ever closer.
 Suddenly, Android 16's head bounces between Gohan and Cell, thrown by Hercule. Android 16 tells Gohan that it's not a crime to fight for good, and that there are some who will never listen to reason. He advises Gohan to set his passions free and to not hold back. He then pleads with Gohan to protect the wild animals and the forests he loved. Cell, however, finally has enough, and smashes Android 16's head, killing him off for good.
 Seeing the innocent android murdered right before his eyes, however, pushes Gohan to his breaking point. He snaps, and his power begins skyrocketing, much to the shock of Cell, the Cell Juniors, and the still-conscious Z-Fighters.
"
Gohan Unleashed,408 (DBZ 214),"The cover shows a white background that has the battle injured and bruised Z Fighters Goku, Yamcha, Krillin, and Tien Shinhan groveling on the ground after being injured by the Cell Jrs. while the bruised Vegeta, Piccolo and Future Trunks are on still up on their feet to continue the battle with the Cell Jrs. but are watching Gohan as Gohan powers up to Super Saiyan 2 out of anger. The battle injured Goku while still on the ground is also watching Gohan's power up.
 Gohan begins his transformation Previously witnessing the absolute torture of his friends and family by the hands of the Cell Juniors, and listening to Android 16's emotional speech pleading to Gohan to protect the Earth just before he gets squashed by the evil Cell, Gohan finally lets his emotions loose. He begins to charge up an incredible amount of ki, something which greatly surprises and shocks everyone on the battlefield, except for Goku, who knew Gohan had this potential all along, discovering it during his and Gohan's one-year training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, and that all Gohan now needed to do was just let it go. Even the Cell Juniors and Cell himself stop to look, showing signs of slight shock, and even fear. Gohan finally stops charging, and has changed in appearance, with much larger, and spikier hair, larger muscle mass, and an aura of lightning, which surrounds his body. Gohan has become a Super Saiyan 2, becoming much more powerful than everyone else present.
 Super Saiyan 2 Gohan kills a Cell Jr. Looking towards Cell with hatred and contempt, Gohan slowly walks towards the confused android, who has not moved a muscle after Gohan transformed. Cell's cocky attitude returns though, and still believes this new power Gohan has achieved is still not enough to overcome Cell's own maximum power. Gohan however, does not attack the android, but instead snatches the bag of Senzu Beans Cell had stolen from Krillin earlier, with Cell not quick enough to react. Gohan, now preparing to make his first strike, with lightning speed, rushes towards the Cell Jr. who was earlier brutally attacking Krillin. Full of rage, Gohan, in a quick flash, neck chops the Cell Jr., decapitating it, and also completely destroying its head, before the Cell Jr. even had a chance to attack or flee. As the deformed Cell Jr. falls to the ground, Cell suddenly raises his eyes in surprise, not believing what he has witnessed. Goku, witnessing the event, now smiles, knowing this would eventually happen. Gohan now prepares to eliminate all the other Cell Jrs. as they all at once try to avenge the first Cell Jr. However, just like the first Cell Jr., these Cell Jrs. are also easily defeated, each one receiving the full force of Gohan's anger, as he takes out each one, one by one. One Cell Jr. notices all his fallen brothers, and decides to flee, flying as fast as it can. Gohan however, catches up with no effort, making the Cell Jr. even more frightened. Gohan finishes it off by chopping the androids neck, making the little beast explode. Cell looks on still shocked, as he has witnessed all his children defeated at the hands of the half Saiyan he earlier deemed weak. Gohan orders Future Trunks to treat to the fallen Z Fighters and heal their wounds, to which Future Trunks accepts, still not believing Gohan's now overbearing strength. As Gohan descends back down to the ground near Cell, Vegeta, almost in denial, cannot believe these events, as earlier the Cell Jr he had fought was overbearing him. Cell and Gohan prepare for the final showdown, a battle which will decide the fate of Planet Earth, and the Z Fighters.
"
Cell vs. Gohan,409 (DBZ 215),"The cover shows Gohan glaring menacingly (presumably at Cell) in his newly acquired Super Saiyan 2 form. In a background box, Cell is shown gritting his teeth.
 Having dispatched with the Cell Juniors, Gohan now stands face-to-face with Cell himself. Revived by a Senzu Bean, Krillin asks Future Trunks how he acquired them. Future Trunks informs him that Gohan took them from Cell, and that they need to get farther away. Krillin is shocked, and wonders if this is what Goku had been referring to earlier. Cell tells Gohan not to get cocky, and asks the young Saiyan if he really thinks he can beat him. Gohan responds by asking Cell what he thinks. Cell is shocked and calls Gohan arrogant. He tells Gohan that he will show him his true power, and proceeds to power up, knocking everyone but himself and Gohan away. Krillin remarks that he can feel the planet trembling, but Gohan seems unfazed.
 Irritated, Cell charges at Gohan and lands a clean punch to the face, but Gohan remains standing and seems unhurt. Cell is shocked and angrily punches again, but this time Gohan grabs his fist. He then punches Cell in the stomach, seemingly hurting the Bio-Android. The rest of the Dragon Team look on in amazement. Cell swipes at Gohan's head, but Gohan ducks and hits Cell with an uppercut to the chin, sending Cell flying backwards. Cell quickly regains his footing, but is bleeding and visibly shaken up. He wonders how it can be possible that he has been hurt by only a few punches. As Goku watches with satisfaction, and Vegeta in disbelief and denial, Jimmy Firecracker informs viewers that their camera is broken, but that Gohan is pummeling Cell.
"
The Ultimate Kamehameha,410 (DBZ 216),"The cover for this page is simply the first three panels of the chapter, which show an angry and injured Cell after Gohan's uppercut, and Gohan walking confidently towards Cell.
 Perfect Cell firing the Earth-Destroying Kamehameha at Super Saiyan 2 Gohan Having hit Cell with a crushing uppercut, Gohan walks confidently towards the bio-android. Cell is now both enraged and scared. Cell throws a powerful kick at Gohan, but Gohan blocks it with merely his left forearm, stunning Cell. After a brief pause, Gohan retaliates by kicking Cell in the face, sending him skidding along the ground. As Cell attempts to regain his composure, he looks back and sees Gohan again walking towards him. As Cell gets back up, Gohan comes to stand face-to-face with him. Cell thinks that he had never thought a stronger being than him could exist, but that Gohan is indeed the stronger of the two of them.
 Super Saiyan 2 Gohan fires the Ultimate Kamehameha at Perfect Cell Despite realizing Gohan's superiority, Cell grins and says that this does not mean that he loses. He then flies up into the air and begins to power up for an Earth-Destroying Kamehameha. As the rest of the Dragon Team watch in horror, Cell states that he will unleash a Kamehameha at full power, which will destroy the Earth unless Gohan takes it head-on. Gohan, however, seems unfazed. As everyone else looks on, Cell unleashes the blast. Vegeta says that it is all over.
 Just as the blast nears the ground, however, Gohan suddenly unleashes a powerful Ultimate Kamehameha directly into Cell's beam. After the beams clash and the dust settles, Gohan's blast is seen traveling off into space, while the Earth is unharmed. Cell is shown to be severely injured, with his left leg, lower right leg, and left arm having been blown off, as well as the tops of the sections protruding from his head. Gohan, looking up to survey the outcome, simply chuckles at the damage he has caused.

"Cell, Brought to Bay",411 (DBZ 217),"
 
 The cover shows Gohan in the foreground, ready to attack. Behind him stand Cell in a defensive stance, and Goku, who is standing stoically. This cover art is also featured in Daizenshuu 1. This chapter is in color, with the cover page having a full color palette and the chapter itself having a yellow/red/green/beige/brown color palette.
 Having taken massive damage from Gohan's Ultimate Kamehameha, Cell questions why Gohan has so much power. Still shocked, Vegeta remarks that Gohan fired an even bigger Kamehameha. As Gohan looks up at Cell with satisfaction, Goku tells him to finish Cell off. Gohan, however, says that Cell deserves to suffer more. Goku is completely taken aback by this response, and Piccolo wonders what has come over Gohan. As Cell screams, Goku urges Gohan to end the battle before Cell tries something desperate. Cell quickly regrows its damaged limbs and ascends up into the air.
 Having risen higher above the battlefield, Cell screams out that Gohan will pay. He makes himself bulkier, then lands on the ground and tells Gohan he will never lose to a thing like him. Cell attempts to punch Gohan, but misses, making a hole in the ground. He then attacks and misses again. Future Trunks realizes that Cell has made the same mistake that he did earlier, sacrificing speed for power. Gohan then dashes in and hits Cell in the face with a devastating kick. Clearly dazed, Cell stumbles around for a few moments before vomiting up Android 18, still seemingly intact. The Dragon Team watch in shock.
 With Android 18 no longer absorbed, Cell reverts to his [Semi-Perfect form. Future Trunks comments that Cell is no longer complete, while Gohan says that this is it for Cell. Enraged, Cell declares that he will not accept this. As Gohan and the others watch in confusion, Cell begins to expand, its body bulging like a balloon.
"
The End of the Cell Game,412 (DBZ 218),"
 
 The cover contains the Dragon Ball logo and the first panel of the chapter, which shows a bulging Cell as he prepares to self-destruct.
 The Dragon Team watch in confusion as Cell continues to bulge. Even Gohan, who has been unfazed by all of Cell's attacks since his Super Saiyan 2 transformation, looks concerned. Cell states that he will self-destruct in 60 seconds, destroying the entire Earth as well. The Z Fighters are stunned, and Gohan angrily tells Cell that he will not let him. He prepares to attack, but Cell tells Gohan that he will explode the second he is hit, so attacking will only hasten the destruction. Frustrated, Gohan holds back, and Cell announces that there are only thirty seconds remaining.
 With the situation looking dire, Yamcha says that the Z Fighters have to do something. Piccolo states that it is no use and nothing can be done. Cell states that only 20 seconds remain. Gohan recalls Goku's urging to finish Cell immediately and falls to his knees, thinking that this is his fault for not doing so. Cell laughs maniacally and says that only 10 seconds now remain.
 Just then, having seemingly come up with something, Goku turns to the rest of the Z Fighters. Krillin asks what it is, and Goku says that he cannot come up with any other way to save the Earth. He then says goodbye and puts his first two fingers to his head in his standard Instant Transmission pose. Unaware of what is occurring, Cell states that everyone loses since the Cell Games ended in a draw. Goku teleports next to Cell. He tells Gohan that he is proud of him and asks to tell Chi-Chi that he is sorry. To the shock of the Z Fighters and Cell, Goku then teleports himself and Cell away to King Kai's Planet. Goku apologizes to King Kai, telling him it was the only place he could go. Cell then explodes, destroying King Kai's planet and killing Goku, King Kai, and Bubbles. Meanwhile, back on Earth, the Z Fighters are still in disbelief over Goku's sacrifice, with Krillin falling to his knees in sorrow.
"
Gohan's Pain,413 (DBZ 219),"The cover shows two photographs of Goku smiling. The left picture shows Goku smiling as an adult with a tree behind him. The right picture shows Goku as a child, smiling and making a V sign as Master Roshi looks on.
 Gohan, on his knees, screams out for his dead father. The rest of the Dragon Team hang their heads in sadness, except for Vegeta, who is seemingly too stunned to react. Jimmy Firecracker wonders where Cell has gone. Gohan regrets letting his pride overtake him, but Krillin tries to comfort him, saying that Goku was proud of him and that they should go home. As they leave, Krillin carries Android 18 off of the battlefield.
 Meanwhile, Goku, King Kai, and Bubbles fly down Snake Way. Goku apologizes to Bubbles for killing him too, but Bubbles seems unaffected. King Kai expresses disbelief with Goku for killing him, a god, just to save Earth. Goku says that he is sorry, and asks King Kai why he cannot let go of it, as it was the only way he could think of. As King Kai gets angry again, Goku wonders if Cell's soul has gone directly to Hell, since he does not see it anywhere. King Kai quickly becomes upset, stating that he cannot sense Cell's soul at the Check-In Station, where all souls go first. He exclaims that this means that Cell is not dead yet, shocking Goku.
 Back on Earth, Vegeta tells Krillin to destroy 18, but he says that she is a person. Just then, a strong gust of wind pops up, accompanied by a ki which the Z Fighters immediately recognize. Before anyone can react, a Death Beam strikes Future Trunks through the chest, knocking him to the ground. Noting that he hit Future Trunks, Cell himself appears, seemingly back in his perfect form. When Yamcha asks how Cell is alive, Cell explains that he has a cluster of core cells in his head that enable him to regenerate from anything and this cluster was not destroyed when he self-destructed. Cell admits that even he was surprised by the extent of his regenerative abilities, and he then goes on to reveal that he no longer needs Android 18 to maintain his Perfect form. To make matters worse for the Z Fighters, Cell explains that he has also received Saiyan Power from his Saiyan cells and gained Goku's Instant Transmission. As Cell boasts that he is better than ever, Vegeta is still stunned by Future Trunks' injuries. As the other stare in disbelief, Gohan stares at Cell, readying himself to fight once again.
"
The Tables Turn,414 (DBZ 220),"The cover consists of two manga panels. The first shows Cell powering up, while the second shows Gohan powering up with an intense expression.
 With Cell having fully regenerated, he and Gohan begin to power up to face off once again. Despite having thought Cell was defeated, Gohan smirks as he powers up. Cell asks Gohan what is so funny, and wonders if he has gone insane. Gohan responds that his arrogance resulted in Goku's death and that he can now avenge him, and wishes that he had killed Cell earlier. Cell says that things will not work out so well for him this time.
 Meanwhile, Vegeta looks back at Future Trunks lying wounded on the ground, and becomes enraged at seeing his son's counterpart hurt. He screams and dashes towards Cell, going Super Saiyan mid-dash. He fires a large Ki Blast at Cell, then follows up with several smaller ones. When the smoke clears, however, Vegeta sees Cell dashing towards him. Cell knocks Vegeta to the ground with one blow, and yells for Vegeta to die. He then fires a Finger Beam in the Saiyan's direction, but a now frantic Gohan dives in front of Vegeta, taking the blow. Cell says that this was a bonus. Gohan gets quickly back to his feet, but with his left arm hanging uselessly. Krillin says that Vegeta's attack was idiotic as the Dragon Balls could have brought Future Trunks back to life.
 Cell lands, and he proclaims that he is done fooling around and has let the battle go on too long. Gohan realizes that Cell's powers have increased more than he thought. Piccolo asks if there are any more Senzu Beans, but Krillin says that they have all been used. Cell begins to charge a massive Kamehameha, and says that all of the Dragon Team will die along with the Earth.
"
Father and Son,415 (DBZ 221),"The cover shows Goku with a confident expression in the background, and Gohan, gritting his teeth while his left arm hangs injured, in the foreground. The text on the sides of the picture says ""The spirit passes...from Goku to Gohan!""
 While preparing to fire his Solar Kamehameha, Cell yells that the Earth will die. Gohan watches, still stunned that Cell is alive. He mentally apologizes to his father, thinking that he should have saved the Earth from Cell, but has failed. Vegeta is still knocked down from his blow by Cell, and he says that he was only a liability and apologizes to Gohan. Gohan is surprised to hear Vegeta apologizing, and realizes that Vegeta knows that they have no hope. Piccolo angrily curses the Dragon Team's powerlessness.
 Father-Son Kamehameha in the Full Color manga Meanwhile, Cell continues to power up his attack, exclaiming that he has enough ki to destroy the Solar System. Around the world, the vibrations caused by Cell powering up are confused for an earthquake. Jimmy Firecracker wonders what Cell is trying to do, and Mr. Satan claims that it is just another trick. Cell urges Gohan to give it his best shot, but Gohan tells him to just get it over with and that he wishes he had finished Cell off first. Cell says that this is a dull ending, but that he is fine with sending everything into oblivion. Just then, Gohan mentally hears the voice of Goku telling him not to give up, and asks where it is coming from.
 Speaking through King Kai's telepathy, Goku tells Gohan that he is in Other World, and that he should fire a Kamehameha just like Cell. Gohan notes that he can only use one arm, and Cell thinks Gohan is talking to himself out of fear. Goku tells Gohan to believe in himself and asks to show him the power they made together. Gohan reluctantly agrees, and Goku urges him to avenge him and King Kai. Gohan apologizes for being cocky, and Goku replies that he is having fun with King Kai and tells Gohan to have fun on Earth once Cell is destroyed. Gohan begins to power up and deliver a Kamehameha with his remaining arm, which surprises Cell and the other Z Fighters. Cell dismisses the gesture due to Gohan's weakened state, and Piccolo says that Gohan's ki is too weak. Cell screams to die, and the two fighters unleash their powerful blasts. Goku is shown behind Gohan, lending his son aid in spirit.
"
Kamehameha vs. Kamehameha,416 (DBZ 222),"The cover, which also serves as a panel of the manga, shows Cell firing his Solar Kamehameha towards Gohan.
 Gohan and Cell both release their Kamehameha blasts, with Gohan using only his right arm. Piccolo urges the Dragon Team to get away, but the beams collide before they can and they are knocked by the collision, as are Mr. Satan, Jimmy Firecracker, and Lionel. The blasts form a massive ball of energy around the point of impact, as the two fighters struggle to overcome the other's beam. The massive amount of energy involved continue to cause earthquake-like effects around the Earth.
 As Gohan and Cell continue to struggle, Piccolo says that Gohan is being overpowered. Cell says that this is it, but Goku telepathically encourages Gohan, saying that he is not using all his power. Gohan says that he is doing his best and cannot do more. Goku says that Gohan is holding back to avoid destroying the planet, but says that the Dragon Balls can fix it. Cell screams goodbye, but is just then hit in the head by a Galick Blazer from behind. Confused, he turns around to see that it was Vegeta who fired the blast.
 With Cell momentarily distracted, Goku senses an opportunity and tells Gohan to use his full power now. Gohan releases his full power into his Kamehameha and overpowers a stunned Cell. As he is blown backwards and destroyed by the blast, Cell says that this is impossible and that he is invincible. With every last trace of Cell destroyed, an exhausted Gohan reverts to his base form and falls to the ground. The Z Fighters look on stunned, while Goku celebrates. Gohan, lying on the ground, manages a smile.
"
Finale,417 (DBZ 223),"The cover of this chapter shows King Kai and Goku with wings and halos in the Other World. This image is used as a scene in ""We Were Angels"", the second ending for Dragon Ball Z.
 Having overpowered Cell's Solar Kamehameha with a Father-Son Kamehameha, Gohan has finally eliminated Cell once and for all, annihilating him down to the last cell. The exhausted Gohan collapses, as the other Z-Fighters gather around him. Yamcha picks him up and they fly him off to The Lookout so Dende can heal him. Piccolo offers to give Vegeta a hand, but Vegeta just brushes him off. After Piccolo leaves, Vegeta remains, his pride shattered after being utterly beaten by Goku and Gohan. He curses Goku for dying the way he did, then flies off, vowing to never fight again.
 With the Z-Fighters gone, Mr. Satan, the ZTV Cameraman, and Jimmy Firecracker are the only ones left on the scene. Seeing that Cell and the Z-Fighters are gone, Mr. Satan quickly spins a story about how he single-handedly defeated Cell. Jimmy announces to the world that the Earth was saved thanks to Mr. Satan, and Mr. Satan is cheered for as the savior of the planet.
 Up on The Lookout, Android 18 regains consciousness after being healed by Dende, and quickly goes on the defensive. Krillin, however, tells her about how Gohan defeated Cell, then Piccolo adds that it was Krillin that took care of Android 18 after she was vomited up by Cell. Gohan quickly realizes that it's because Krillin is in love with Android 18, though broadcasting this gets him smacked on the head by Krillin. Android 18, however, completely blows him off and flies away from The Lookout, leaving Krillin depressed.
 Piccolo then turns their attention to undoing the damage caused by Cell. Mr. Popo brings out the collected Dragon Balls, and Shenron is summoned. The sky suddenly going dark gets Android 18's attention, and she flies back to The Lookout to see what's going on. Yamcha makes the first wish, which is to bring back to life everyone killed by Cell. This brings Trunks back from the dead. However, Goku isn't resurrected, because he had already been brought back to life by the Dragon Balls before. They try to think of a way to bring Goku back, but then Goku himself intervenes.
 Goku, speaking through King Kai, tells them that the world will be better off if he remains in the Afterlife, because his presence seems to attract bad guys. He talks about the benefits he gets in the afterlife, such as keeping his body, not aging anymore, and getting to meet the great old martial arts masters from history. He leaves the protection of the Earth to the much more dependable (in Goku's view) Gohan, and says a final goodbye to everyone. Krillin can't help but laugh at Goku being the only person who could be cheerful even though he's dead. Shenron, meanwhile, is still waiting for the second wish.
"
"Farewell, Warriors",418 (DBZ 224),"The cover depicts the first scene of the Chapter, with Shenron still awaiting the second wish.
 Shenron is still awaiting the second wish from the Z-Fighters. Since they can't bring back Goku as he suggests that the Earth would be safe if he didn't come back this time, they try to think of something else. Yamcha mentions his girlfriend's been wanting an expensive necklace, but Krillin cuts in and asks if it's possible to turn Android 17 and Android 18 back into humans. Android 18, eavesdropping on this, is shocked. Shenron, however, says that the Androids are too strong to change against their will.
 Krillin thinks some more, while Yamcha asks why he mentioned Android 17. Piccolo points out that he would have been revived by their first wish, since he was killed by Cell. Krillin comes up with a plan B, and asks if it's possible to remove the bombs from their bodies. Since it doesn't weaken or change their fundamental nature of their being, Shenron grants the wish and removes the bombs from Android 17 and Android 18, then disappears, scattering the Dragon Balls once again.
 Future Trunks asks why Krillin would wish for that, and Krillin answers that he felt bad for them, having to go through life with a bomb in their bodies. Krillin apologizes to Yamcha about the necklace, but Yamcha just laughs it off as a joke. Tien Shinhan then asks why Krillin removed the bomb from 17 as well, and Krillin answers that 17's the perfect guy for her, despite how much he himself likes her. Piccolo is left confused by the talk about love.
 Android 18, who's still been eavesdropping, comes out into the open and berates Krillin, since 17 and her are twins, not lovers. She also tells him not to get any wrong ideas, because she doesn't plan on showing any gratitude for him taking out her bomb. Regardless, she does give a ""Later,"" as she leaves The Lookout again, and Yamcha tells Krillin that there's still hope. Krillin admits, however, it's hard to feel hopeful about anything without Goku around.
 Tien decides it's time to leave, since Chiaotzu is likely worried about him. He tells the others they may never meet again, and wishes Trunks luck against the androids in the future before leaving. The rest of the group go their separate ways as well, Trunks declaring he plans to return to the future tomorrow. Piccolo decides to stay at the Lookout, but tells Gohan he can visit whenever he likes.
 The Z-Fighters separate for the last time, saying farewells to Dende, Mr. Popo, Korin, and Yajirobe as they do. As Yamcha and Trunks fly back to Capsule Corporation, Yamcha tells Trunks how Vegeta lost it after Trunks was killed by Cell. Trunks is amazed that his father would show that much emotion for him. Meanwhile, at Goku's House, Gohan gives Chi-Chi the news about Goku's death, causing her to break down crying.
 The next day, Yamcha, Puar, Gohan, Krillin, and Master Roshi have come to Capsule Corporation to see Trunks off on his return to the future. Even Vegeta gives Trunks a wave goodbye as he enters his Time Machine and departs to return to his time. As Trunks leaves, Gohan, Krillin, and Yamcha watch him go, with a vision of Goku in the background also watching.
"
The Other Outcome,419 (DBZ 225),"The cover shows Future Trunks giving a thumbs up as he has a smile on his face.
 Future Bulma welcomes her son Future Trunks The chapter begins with Future Trunks coming back to his own timeline to meet his mother Future Bulma. She is shocked at how much her son has grown, which causes him to talk about the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, but Future Bulma asks him how it had go. Future Trunks then tells his mother that Goku died, but Gohan avenged him. Future Trunks then shares his thought about how Vegeta went crazy when Cell killed him with his Full Power Death Beam, which leaves Future Bulma surprised. A radio then announces that the Androids are attacking Parsley City, and Future Trunks decides that it is his cue.
 Future Bulma discussing with her son As Future Trunks races to the scene, Future Android 18 is seen blowing up large portions of the city, and Future Android 17 comments on how she could not beat a video game, which makes her tell Future 17 to shut up. An old man tries to shoot Future 17, but fails. Future 17 unholsters his Gun, then goes to kill the man by shooting him, though is interrupted by Future Trunks arrival on the scene.
 Future Android 17 can't believe Trunks was foolish enough to try again after how badly he was beaten last time they met, and Future Android 18 wants to get rid of Trunks once and for all. Future Trunks, however, easily deflects Future Android 18's Ki Blast, and counters with one of his own, annihilating her.
 Future Android 17 is stunned by how easily Future Trunks destroyed Future Android 18, and then Future Trunks attacks him, kicking him away, then destroying him with another Ki Blast. He finally believes everything is over, but no. There's still one last problem to take care of.
 Three years later, Future Trunks is preparing to go back in time to tell everyone he managed to destroy the Androids, but then tells his mother to step back, knowing that Future Cell has arrived. He knows Future Cells' plan is to kill Future Trunks, take his time machine, and go back to the past so he can absorb Android 17 and Android 18 to obtain his perfect form. This time, Future Trunks isn't going to let it happen, and he's going to put an end to everything.
"
Peace to the Future,420 (DBZ 226),"Future Trunks is standing, glaring. In an image behind him is Future Cell, in his Imperfect Form.
 Future Cell appears Three years have passed since Future Trunks had defeated Future Android 17 and Future Android 18. Now only one last obstacle to peace for the future remains: Future Cell. Trunks knows all about Cell's plan to kill him, steal his time machine, and return to the past to absorb Androids 17 and 18, and this time, Trunks isn't going to let that happen.
 Future Cell realizes that Trunks has already gone to the past, which is why he knows so much. But according to the calculations of the spy robots, Cell says that Trunks couldn't even defeat Androids 17 and 18, much less him. However, Trunks asks where the Androids are now, which is when Cell realized that Trunks destroyed them. Trunks, not wanting their fight to ruin all of West City's rebuilding, launches Cell away with a Kiai, then flies after him to an abandoned location.
 Cell admits that Trunks has gotten stronger, but readies for battle anyway. Trunks transforms into his Super Saiyan form, and Cell powers up as well. As they fight, however, it's clear that Trunks has the advantage, eventually catching Cell by his tail and flings him upwards. Cell begins to charge up a Kamehameha, but then sees Trunks charging up a Heat Dome Attack, which he fires, destroying Future Cell. With Future Cell destroyed, peace is finally assured for Trunks' timeline...

Herculopolis High,421 (DBZ 227),"The cover shows a now adolescent and physically taller Gohan, standing and saluting in his outfit that he wears to Orange Star High School, while an image of a mean faced looking Videl can be seen in a background panel of the cover. Master Roshi is also present next to the Dragon Ball logo in the cover saying that Dragon Ball is not over yet even though Goku is not around as the series will still continue with his oldest son, Gohan.
 The chapter begins with a synopsis of the events happening seven years after the battle with Cell. With Goku's sacrifice, the Earth and its people could live again in peace. Mr. Satan was now the believed savior of the world, and a city was established in his honor, where millions of peaceful Earthlings were living.
 A group of criminals were shown robbing a bank, promising to return once they've spent the money. Now 16 years old (18 in the anime as he was 11 when fighting Cell), Gohan is shown riding the Flying Nimbus to his first day of high school at Orange Star High School in Satan City. After the past 7 years of homestyle tutoring and coorespondance courses, Chi-Chi wanted Gohan to have a normal school life, so he was enrolled in Orange Star High School.
 Telling goodbye to the Flying Nimbus until after school, Gohan landed in Satan City. Noticing he was late, he looked around to see if anyone was watching, then proceeded to run full-speed toward school, surprising a couple driving a car past him. Gohan then noticed the commotion going on at the bank being robbed. Gohan then decided to do something about the robbery and transformed into a Super Saiyan to hide his identity. Gohan single-handedly eliminated the robbers, effortlessly catching a round of bullets from the gun a robber was firing at him. The remainder of the robbers tried to flee in a truck, prompting Gohan to use a Kiai to knock the truck over. When the police finally arrived to the scene, they found the defeated robbers and wondered what happened.
 Videl appeared behind Gohan and asked him what happened, as the police could not have done something like this. Saying he didn't see anything, Gohan secretly fled from the scene while a man told Videl that the Golden Warrior (Gohan's nickname as a Super Saiyan) was responsible. The man then told Videl that the Golden Warrior also attended Orange Star High School, as their school badges are the same. Videl then wondered who went to her school that had golden hair.
 Later at Orange Star High School, Videl asked Sharpner if he was the Golden Warrior, who declined stating he was too busy exercising to defeat some robbers. As Erasa commented that the Golden Warrior may be stronger than Mr. Satan, the teacher introduced Gohan as the new student in the class. Secretly calling Gohan handsome, Erasa welcomes Gohan to an empty seat next to her, and introduces Gohan to Videl, stating she is Mr. Satan's daughter, which shocks Gohan.
"
Undercover,422 (DBZ 228),"The cover shows Videl charging for an attack in the foreground of the cover while both Gohan and Mr. Satan are present in the background. Mr. Satan is seen smiling while Gohan has an expression of shock in his face.
 Gohan expresses surprise that Videl was the daughter of Mr. Satan, with Erasa also telling him to be grateful as her father is the reason they are alive today (which, in reality, is due to Gohan defeating Cell, not Mr. Satan). Videl recognized Gohan from the bank robbery crime scene earlier that morning, asking him if he knew about the Golden Warrior, which Gohan declines.
 Erasa enlightened Gohan about the Golden Warrior, telling him that this morning was the third time he prevented criminals from committing crimes. Gohan, in his mind, realized they were talking about him as a Super Saiyan, stopping crimes the two times he came to the city to register for school, and this morning. Videl also commented that she received reports about the Golden Warrior wearing their high school badge, along with a black vest over a white shirt, and light tan pants, which was the exact outfit Gohan was wearing. Sharpner reassured her, stating that Gohan did not have golden hair and he had a frail appearance altogether. Erasa agreed with him, jokingly stating that Gohan did not look very strong. Videl had doubts, remembering that in Mr. Satan's old tapes of the Cell Games, there were warriors that could turn their hair golden. She also remembered Mr. Satan saying that they were tricks.
 Erasa asked Gohan if he lived anywhere nearby, and Gohan replied that he lived in the Eastern 439th District in the countryside, which a surprised Erasa commented that even in a jet it would take 5 hours to get to the city. Thinking for an excuse, Gohan told her that living very far away was his reason for being late to class.
 Later, Gohan and his classmates are in PE class, preparing to play baseball. Sharpner asked if Gohan knew how to play baseball, which he replied by stating he never played but he knew the basics. Sharpner laughed in disbelief. Videl instructs Gohan to play outfield. While the play started, Gohan thought to himself what his mother and Bulma told him; not to show off his true strength and power. As Sharpner went up to bat, Videl told him not to get his hopes up, and pitched the ball towards him, who hits it far into the air. To the shock of everyone, Gohan leaped many feet in the air to catch the ball. Noticing that a player left third base, Gohan tried to throw the baseball to the third base as soft as he could, but the third base catcher caught the ball and was knocked back a few meters away.
 The coach commended Gohan for jumping high into the air, and Gohan told him that he just got lucky. It was now Gohan's turn to try and hit the ball, leading everyone to wonder how Gohan will act. As Gohan promised himself that he won't show off anymore of his power and refused to hit the ball, Sharpner pitched the ball towards him, which hit Gohan flat in the face and knocked off his cap. Shunning Gohan for not attempting to hit or avoid the ball, a surprised Sharpner noticed that Gohan was unfazed by the ball's impact and wondered ""what he was.""
 Later, while Gohan was at his locker, Sharpner approached him and gave him an offer for joining a boxing club, to which Gohan denied, and Erasa appeared telling Sharpner he lived too far to join any clubs. Erasa then asked Gohan to give her a ride home, and Gohan replied that his car only had one seat (Gohan didn't want them to know that his mode of transportation was a flying cloud). As Gohan headed out of the city, Videl decided to follow him, thinking something was strange since Gohan lived many miles away and did not use a car or a jet. Noticing he was being followed, Gohan made Videl lose his trail by jumping on top of a building. While riding away on the Flying Nimbus, Gohan commented that city life was difficult and decided to go to Bulma for advice on keeping his crime-fighting identity a secret.
"
A Hero Is Born!,423 (DBZ 229),"The cover features the face of the Great Saiyaman Gohan with his helmet on.
 To open the chapter, Gohan flew to Capsule Corporation to ask Bulma for advice to keep his crime-fighting identity a secret. Bulma suggested to make a device to instantly create a disguise for Gohan to wear, to which Gohan happily agreed to. Bulma then asked Gohan to wait for two hours and the disguise will be ready. Asking where Bulma's son was, Bulma answered that he was training with his father, who is planning to make Trunks stronger than Gohan himself. Looking for the training room, Gohan comments to himself about how big Capsule Corporation was. Trunks then appears and says hello to Gohan, who asks Trunks if Vegeta was really training him. Gohan then says hello to Vegeta, to which the Saiyan prince replies to Gohan that he will get rusty if he overlooks his training.
 After two hours, Bulma gives Gohan a device resembling a watch to instantly give him a disguise, leading Trunks to comment on how lame Gohan looked while wearing it. Thanking Bulma, Gohan went home. Telling the Flying Nimbus to fly home at maximum speed, Gohan expressed joy that his identity won't be so easily discovered while fighting crime.
 The next morning on his way to school, Gohan decided to put on his new disguise, knowing that if he flies to school himself he will be faster than the Flying Nimbus and no one would know who he is. While flying, Gohan noticed a car driving recklessly on a freeway and stopped right in front of it. As the driver and his companion step out of the car and prepare to attack Gohan with a knife, they ask who Gohan was. Gohan replied by striking a pose and calling himself the Great Saiyaman, which prompts the two criminals to start laughing. Angrily stomping on the ground and creating a hole, Gohan tells them he worked hard on that name. Scared of this, the two drivers stopped laughing and agreed to drive safely.
"
Videl's Emergency!!,424 (DBZ 230),"The cover depicts the opening scene, with Gohan off to school.
 Gohan is off to school again, changing into his Great Saiyaman costume before leaving. Now that he can use the costume to protect his identity, he leaves Flying Nimbus to his younger brother, Goten. After taking a quick flight to school, Gohan reverts his costume after landing on the roof. As he enters the school, he meets one of his schoolmates, who talks about the new superhero in town that wasn't the Golden Warrior. He calls him the ""Great Tireman,"" which Gohan reflexively corrects. When asked how he knows about it, Gohan quickly covers it up, saying he heard it from somebody who saw him.
 In class, Gohan hears Videl's watch go off, and she apparently responds to an emergency call from Backpack Town about two armed robbers fleeing on Route 8 towards the mountains. Videl quickly runs out the room, without the teacher even trying to stop her. Gohan asks Erasa what's going on, and she talks about how Videl has a hobby of being a champion of justice, since Mr. Satan's her father. Gohan is shocked that the police ask her for help, but Sharpner tells him not to underestimate Videl, since she could rival Hercule.
 Gohan, knowing Hercule's true strength, wonders if she's getting in over her head. Eventually, he makes an excuse that he has to use the restroom and runs off. Quickly making his way to the roof, Gohan transforms into the Great Saiyaman and takes off. Unfortunately, it occurs to him that he has no idea where Route 8 is, so he has to wait to feel Videl's Ki.
 At Route 8, the robbers are driving down the road, with the police in pursuit. One of them pulls out a rocket launcher and fires it at the chasing cars, blowing one of them up. However, they're forced to stop the car when they see Videl's airplane blocking the road. Videl is waiting, holding a pair of handcuffs, and tells them to drop their weapons and put their hands up. One of the robbers approaches her, looking for a fight, but Videl jumps up and kicks him in the head, which reveals her ki to Gohan, who quickly flies that way.
 Videl, however, is seen easily holding her own against the robber, knocking him around with ease. Gohan is impressed, thinking Videl might be better than her father. Gohan spots the other robber pointing a gun at Videl's back, and cuts in, knocking the gun out of his hand and crushing it with his own hand. The robber yells, ""Who are you?!"", to which Gohan replies ""That... I'll reveal in the next chapter!""
"
Revealed!!!,425 (DBZ 231),"The cover depicts the opening scene, where Gohan (as the Great Saiyaman) begins his introduction.
 The robber asks again who Gohan is, and Gohan proceeds with a lengthy introduction filled with ridiculous posing, introducing himself as ""The New Hero in town, The Champion of Justice, The Great Saiyaman!!!!"" Videl and the robber are left dumbfounded by his introduction, but then Gohan tells Videl to cuff them, using her name, which gives away his identity to her. The robber, however, throws down a smoke bomb and attempts to escape in the car.
 Gohan, however, has flown up into the air to get above the smoke, and quickly flies off after him, shocking Videl, who realizes that flying isn't just a trick. Gohan proceeds to catch up with and knock out the robber, bringing him back so Videl can cuff him. Videl then tricks Gohan into revealing his identity by asking him a direct question using his name, which Gohan answers without thinking, blowing his cover completely.
 As they fly back to Orange Star High School in Videl's plane, Videl asks him about the ridiculous outfit, which Gohan responds that his friends told him to keep his power a secret if he wanted a normal life. Videl then asks him if Gohan's the Golden Warrior, which Gohan denies, knowing that identity has to stay secret.
 Videl changes the subject, talking about the upcoming World Martial Arts Tournament, and quickly deducing that Gohan is the son of a former champion, Goku. She then blackmails Gohan into entering the tournament by threatening to reveal his secret identity to everyone. Left with no choice, Gohan agrees. Videl also wants Gohan to teach her how to fly, to which Gohan again reluctantly agrees.
 Videl returns to class first, and Gohan soon follows after changing out of his costume. He's mocked for ""taking so long in the bathroom,"" and he slumps into his seat, calling this ""the worst day ever.""

Strongest in the Heavens!,426 (DBZ 232),"The cover depicts Gohan in a combat stance while in his Super Saiyan form.
 At Capsule Corporation, Gohan tells Bulma about how he's being blackmailed into entering the World Martial Arts Tournament by Videl, who saw through his Great Saiyaman disguise. Bulma offers to fix his helmet so it alters his voice, but Gohan points out that he can't wear helmets or armor in the tournament and asks if there was something that could replace the helmet. Bulma comes up with a workaround, replacing the helmet with a bandanna and sunglasses, which unfortunately do little to reduce just how ridiculous the costume is.
 When Bulma points out that Gohan would have no competition when he enters the Tournament, Vegeta enters, deciding to compete as well, wanting to see if he's surpassed Gohan by continuing to train while Gohan ""frolicked in peace."" Trunks is excited by the thought of Gohan and his dad fighting one another, but then an unexpected voice chimes in, saying that he wants to compete too.
 It's Goku, talking through King Kai from the Other World. Goku reveals that he gets one day to visit the living realm, and he decides to make it the day of the Tournament, so he can compete as well. With the Tournament now getting even more interesting, Gohan flies off to tell the others about the Tournament and Goku's return.
 His first stop is the Kame House, where we see Krillin (now with hair since he stopped shaving his head), Android 18, and their daughter Marron. When Gohan reveals that the top 5 places win prize money, Android 18 quickly badgers Krillin into entering. Next, Gohan heads for The Lookout, where he tells Piccolo, Dende, and Mr. Popo about the upcoming tournament. Piccolo agrees to enter, but Dende refuses, since he's a healer, not a warrior.
 Gohan doesn't know where Tien Shinhan is, and Bulma would tell Yamcha, so that covers everyone Gohan knows. Gohan then begins to wonder how Chi-Chi would take the news that Goku was coming back, and if she'd even allow him to compete. As it turns out, once he mentions the prize money, Chi-Chi immediately gives him permission both to compete and to take time off from school to train for it.
 The next day, Gohan's ready to get back to training, with the help of his brother, Goten.
"
Let the Training Begin!,427 (DBZ 233),"The cover has Gohan and Goten in combat stances, ready to train together.
 Gohan decides to begin his training by going Super Saiyan and practicing his reflexes. He gathers a pile of rocks, draws a line in the dirt, and tells Goten to throw the rocks at him from there. Goten asks if he's sure Gohan wants to start that close, but at Gohan's insistence, Goten throws a rock. Gohan is caught by surprise at how hard Goten can throw, and only manages to barely get out of the way as the rock flies at him, and it slams into the cliff behind him, smashing it.
 Realizing Goten's a lot stronger than he was expecting, Gohan moves the line further back. Goten starts throwing the rocks again, and Gohan manages to dodge them easily now. Eventually, Goten stops throwing the rocks and asks if he can go Super Saiyan like Gohan. Gohan laughs, telling him it would take a long time for him to be strong enough to go Super Saiyan, but then Goten goes Super Saiyan, utterly shocking Gohan.
 Changing his plan, Gohan asks him if he knows what ""kumite"" (freestyle fighting) is, and Goten tells him that Chi-Chi was teaching him how to fight while Gohan was working on homework. When Gohan asks if Chi-Chi knows Goten can go Super Saiyan, Goten says he showed her once, and she said it made him look like a punk. Knowing that feeling too well, Gohan laughs about it.
 A bit later, Gohan and Goten are going at it in full-contact sparring. Gohan manages to avoid one of Goten's kicks by flying into the air. Goten calls Gohan a cheater because Goten doesn't know how to fly, stumping Gohan again. Gohan then sees a familiar airplane fly by, and realizes Videl's on her way to his house. Gohan tells Goten not to go Super Saiyan in front of her.
 As they run back to their house, Goten is amazed at how strong Gohan was, but Gohan says Goten could enter the tournament too if he trained hard enough. Goten then tells Gohan that Trunks is even stronger than him, and Gohan starts to get worried that the kids will leave him in the dust if he's not careful.
 Gohan and Goten return to their house, where they find Videl and Chi-Chi in an argument. Gohan just sighs, saying he only wanted to train quietly.
"
Videl Learns to Fly,428 (DBZ 234),"The cover depicts Gohan, Goten, and Videl standing with their arms folded. Goten and Gohan are looking straight ahead, while Videl is looking at Gohan.
 Gohan is ready to teach Goten and Videl how to fly, saying it's just a matter of controlling their ki. Unfortunately, Videl doesn't know what Ki is. Goten demonstrates by firing a Ki Blast to destroy a nearby rock. Videl calls is a trick, but Gohan says it's real power. Videl's still never heard of it, so Gohan sends Goten off to play while he teaches Videl how to access her ki.
 A bit later, Chi-Chi makes lunch for Gohan, Goten, and even Videl. Videl is impressed by Chi-Chi's cooking, saying it's better than what their chef makes. Chi-Chi asks if Videl's family runs a restaurant, but she answers that they just hire a chef for their meals. Chi-Chi is amazed that they have a personal chef, and asks how big her mansion is. Videl answers that her mansion is maybe 50 rooms, which makes Chi-Chi realize Videl's family is really rich. Chi-Chi then asks when Gohan's going to marry Videl, causing him to do a spit take of his food.
 A bit later after lunch, Videl finally gets the hang of accessing her ki. Gohan praises her for being such a quick study. Videl asks if this means she can fly now, but Gohan says no, saying she has to learn to be able to control her ki at will.
 Meanwhile, in the other world, Goku is hard at work training, with heavy weighted pads on his wrists and ankles. King Kai is watching him train. Just then, the South Kai arrives, surprised that people still train the way Goku is. The South Kai had come to see one of the top fighters of the North, and asks how heavy the weights are. King Kai says they're two tons each, much to South Kai's shock.
 South Kai quickly regains his composure, however, bragging about one of his strongest warriors from the southern planets, Papoye. King Kai invites South Kai to bring Papoye to Earth for the World Martial Arts Tournament, and South Kai agrees. King Kai then asks if Goku wants to go heavier, offering to ramp up the weights to ten tons. Even Goku is taken aback by this, until King Kai informs him that he can go Super Saiyan.
 Goku then agrees, and the South Kai turns the weights up to ten tons. Goku goes Super Saiyan and starts throwing punches and kicks like he's wearing nothing at all. South Kai quickly changes his tune about entering Papoye in the tournament, and walks off. King Kai flashes a victory sign.
 Back on Earth, Videl has managed to gain enough control of her ki to begin floating. Gohan continues to be impressed with how fast a learner Videl is. Goten, however, has rapidly mastered flight and is flying around freely. Gohan reassures Videl that once she gets some training, she'll be able to fly like him.
 Videl says she'll come back tomorrow, to Gohan's surprise. Gohan says she's already learned all she needs to, and can learn the rest on her own. Videl says she wants to learn more about Ki, and asks if she's a bother to have around. Gohan says no, so Videl reaffirms that she'll come back tomorrow.
 Before Videl can leave, however, Gohan suggests she cut her hair short. Videl blushes a bit, thinking Gohan prefers girls with short hair. Gohan obliviously states that it's for practical reasons, since short hair would be better in a fight. Videl just screams that her hair is her business and flies off.
 Nevertheless, the next day, Videl returns with her hair cut short. Gohan finds himself confused, not understanding girls at all.
"
Fathers,429 (DBZ 235),"The cover shows a happy Great Saiyaman Gohan standing behind a blue background in a panel.
 In the Capsule Corporation Gravity Room, Vegeta is in all out training mode. Trunks is also in the room, but he's straining under the heavy gravity. Vegeta tells him to leave, but Trunks says that Goten called and said he's entering the World Martial Arts Tournament, so Trunks wants to get ready for it too. Trunks then goes Super Saiyan and then starts jumping and running around with ease, much to Vegeta's surprise.
 Vegeta asks can Goten go Super Saiyan as well, and Trunks confirms this. Vegeta then challenges Trunks to try and hit him, saying if Trunks can land one blow on his face, he'll take Trunks to the amusement park. Trunks immediately takes Vegeta up on that challenge and goes at him, throwing punches with amazing speed. Vegeta manages to keep his guard up for a while, but one of Trunks' punches gets through and strikes his face. Vegeta immediately punches back, sending Trunks flying.
 Vegeta realizes he may have hit Trunks a bit too hard, but says he never said he wouldn't hit back. Nevertheless, he intends to keep his promise, but first asks Trunks who's the stronger of him and Goten. Trunks says he's a little stronger, because he has an age advantage and Goten hasn't learned to fly yet. Vegeta is taken aback at just how strong the next generation is becoming.
 Meanwhile, Videl is shown to be getting really good at ki control, as she's now floating a good ways above the ground. Goten, however, is still flying freely, and Videl wonders when she'll get that good. Gohan answers he doesn't know, so Videl says she'll come every day until she can. Gohan then suggests to Goten that he rein it in while Videl's around.
 Videl then take a break, telling Gohan not to say anything to her father about her learning to fly, because she wants it to be a surprise. She also doesn't want her father to know that she's going to a boy's house, since he won't let her go out with anybody weaker than him. But since he's the World Champion, everybody's weaker than him. Gohan asks if she's ever practiced with her father, and she says no. Gohan grins, knowing Videl doesn't realize she's a lot stronger than Hercule.
 Gohan changes the subject, asking if Videl would be disappointed if her father lost. Videl just laughs, saying she'd be glad to see someone knock her father down a peg, to Gohan's delight. Videl then asks who taught Gohan his talents. Gohan answers that it was his father, before he died. Videl asks if his father was strong, and Gohan confirms this. Goten then blurts out that their father is coming back for the tournament, despite Gohan just saying he died. Videl takes it that their father actually divorced their mother, and secretly told them he was coming back for the tournament, but not her. Videl then shrugs the whole thing off and they get back to training.
 Ten days later, Videl has developed her flight skills to the point of being able to fly freely, putting an end to her training with Gohan. This allows Gohan and Goten to get serious about their own training to get ready for the upcoming Tournament and their chance to see their father again!
"
The Dragon Team Returns!,430 (DBZ 236),"The cover of this chapter shows the Dragon Team who are contestants in the 25th World Martial Arts Tournament. This image is used as a scene in ""We Gotta Power"", the second opening for Dragon Ball Z.
 The World Martial Arts Tournament draws ever closer. Those who plan to participate have been finalizing their training and getting into the spirit. Gohan, Vegeta, Piccolo, Krillin, Goten, Trunks, Videl, Mr. Satan (reading a magazine), and Goku all continue their training. ""And so, it has begun at last!!! The World Martial Arts Tournament, that is, after such a truly long time. almost everyone is headed to the tournament in a plane being flown by Bulma. Chi-Chi asks Yamcha if he'll be participating, but he says not this time. In the front row of the plane, Gohan doubts his father will recognize Krillin with his hair, which makes Krillin chuckle.
 Gohan then asks Vegeta, Goten, and Trunks not to turn Super Saiyan at the tournament, with Bulma thinking that's a good idea since they'll be on TV and could be recognized from the battle with Cell. Vegeta thinks he could destroy all the TVs, but Gohan says he mustn't. Vegeta relents, though, saying he’ll win either way. The boys are okay with that, too. At the tournament, there's a huge crowd, and they don't see Goku anywhere. Mr. Satan arrives, and the crowd rushes toward him. He greets his fans, and they start chanting “SATAN” for him. An interviewer starts talking to Mr. Satan and he tells her that he has a 120% chance of winning. The interviewer tries to ask Videl about her haircut, but she ignores it. Goten then spots Piccolo, and Gohan goes over and asks him if he's seen his father, but he hasn't. Just then, Goku lands, with Fortuneteller Baba beside him.
 Pretty much everyone starts to tear up, and runs to hug him, except Piccolo, Vegeta, Android 18, and the two boys. Baba says she'll be back in twenty-four hours, and heads off. Goku then wonders if that lookalike is his son, but Goten just hides behind Chi-Chi. Piccolo suggests that they all hurry up and sign in. At the registration table Trunks is annoyed to find out that there's now a Youth Division, for everyone under fifteen, although Krillin is happy to hear that… The fighters all head inside, and everyone wishes them their best.
"
The Preliminaries Begin,431 (DBZ 237),"The cover features the opening scene of the chapter where it shows members of the Dragon Team walking toward the World Martial Arts Tournament arena.
 As they head towards the preliminaries, Goku notices that Krillin isn't bald. Trunks tells Goten he really does look like his dad, but doesn't think he looks as strong compared to his own dad. Goten says that Gohan told him their father is the strongest in the universe. Then Goku notices that No. 18 is here too, and Krillin tells him that they live together at Master Roshi's house, and have a kid. Goku is shocked, and wonders how robots can have kids. Krillin tells him she's still a human who was modified a bit. As they approach the arena the interview lady and her cameraman notice the group coming their way. She first tries talking to Vegeta and Piccolo, but they simply ignore her. She thinks they looked familiar, though. Goku, however, says that he came from Other World and explains that his halo is not an accessory, you get it when you die. Piccolo decides to telekinetically destroy the camera before Goku says too much more, and the interviewer scolds the cameraman for breaking the camera.
 A tournament attendant leads them inside, pointing out the changing room if they need it. Krillin, Trunks, and Vegeta all go in to change, with Krillin saying the only people who'll put up a decent fight are their friends. A man thinks Piccolo doesn't look okay, because of his complexion. When everyone is together again, they head out for the preliminaries and bump into the announcer. The announcer is very happy to see Goku and Krillin, and says he knows it wasn't really Mr. Satan who defeated Cell. He thinks the tournament will be much better with them participating, and tells Piccolo not to destroy the entire arena like last time. Then the announcer asks about the ring above Goku's head. Goku tells him he died during the battle with Cell and came back from Other World for today. The announcer thinks that""s not too weird, for them, and then heads off.
 The preliminaries are starting, and not including the Youth Division there are 194 people here, but only sixteen can participate. Mr. Satan will participate automatically, since he is the reigning champion, but they'll now pick the remaining fifteen using a Punch Machine. The fifteen highest scores will pass. Mr. Satan will demonstrate the punch machine, saying no one can do better than him (Krillin smugly says otherwise). Piccolo again telekinetically destroys all the cameras, and says he did it for Gohan's sake. Gohan is very grateful, while everyone else is completely confused. Gohan goes off to search for a friend, just as Mr. Satan prepares to use the punch machine (now disappointed the world won't see).
 Satan psyches himself up, and then punches the machine, getting a score of 137. He encourages the other fighters and then heads inside, exhausted. The attendants tell everyone to line up at the punch machine, while the kids need to come this way. Goku wonders where Tien Shinhan and Chiaotzu are, and Krillin says something about how they said ""we'll probably never meet again"". Some people go through the line, and finally it's #84's turn: No. 18. Krillin tells her to go lightly and not break the machine. No. 18 nonchalantly punches it, and scores 774. They think the machine is malfunctioning, and Krillin scolds her as they ""fix"" it. Her second score is more acceptable with a 203. #85, Krillin, gets 192. #86, Goku, gets 186. #87, Piccolo, gets 210. The attendant thinks it must really be broken, but then Vegeta destroys the machine with his punch, leaving everyone absolutely stunned.
"
The Two Little Warriors,432 (DBZ 238),"The cover features Goten and Trunks standing in a fighting stance, with both fighters noticeably smiling at the reader.
 Gohan asks Videl how her flying is going, and she asks him why he isn't shocked that person destroyed the Punch Machine. Everyone in that group got over 200, and her dad's record was only 139. In the meantime the rest of the contestants will have to wait for another punch machine, so Goku suggests to Vegeta they go watch the Youth Division. Videl continues wondering about that group, as they come over toward Gohan, with Goku noting that his friend was a girl. Krillin says she's a very cute girl, at that. Goku says they're all going to watch Trunks and Goten, and then head off. Videl can't believe Gohan knows them, and he explains that the one in the ""mountain smoke-colored"" dōgi was his father. Videl had thought his father was dead, and Gohan says that's why he has the halo above his head.
 The announcer says the winner of the Youth Division gets 10,000,000 zenny, and the runner up will receive 5,000,000. The winner will also get to participate in a special attraction fight against Mr. Satan. Mr. Satan then runs out to the ring, but slips and falls. Everyone watches on as Mr. Satan writhes in pain, but he quickly jumps up and says that it was just a joke. Inside, Goten says he'll buy toys and candy with his prize money. Trunks wants to buy more mature things, and Goten comments that Trunks is from the richest family in the world. Two other kids are talking, and one kid with a mullet says he's lucky to have gotten Trunks for an opponent. The mullet kid goes over to Trunks and asks if he's got his diaper on for when he pisses himself, but Trunks just insults his hair. The mullet kid gets pissed, but Trunks remains calm. Back outside the announcer asks how Mr. Satan is feeling. Unfortunately for his opponents, he's feeling very healthy!
 But now it's time for the Junior Division of the World Martial Arts Tournament to begin. Krillin thinks everything's gotten so much flashier, and Goku says the ring's much bigger. Of course, Piccolo doesn't like any of it. The rules are the same as for adults: Giving up, ring out, being down for a ten count, or being knocked out all result in a loss. However, there won't be any preliminaries for the Junior Division, and all thirty-five kids will fight in the main ring. Outside, Gohan and Videl are still lined up at the punch machine, unable to watch.
 Some time passes, and the ninth match is Trunks, age 8, versus Idasa, age 15 (the mullet kid). They head to the ring and Idasa's mom cheers him on, insulting Trunks in the process. But, she happens to be sitting next to Bulma, who then cheers Trunks on. The announcer calls for the match begin and Trunks quickly sweeps Idasa off his feet, kicks him up into the air, and he's knocked out as he crashes face first into the ring. Idasa's mom is devastated, Bulma laughs, and Krillin thinks it’ll be really boring until Goten and Trunks fight. Trunks tells Goten this was why he wanted to fight adults.
"
Trunks vs. Goten,433 (DBZ 239),"The cover features the opening scenes of the chapter where it shows a kid declared the winner after the other kid has bursted into tears and another panel of Goten entering the fighting arena with Ikose, ready to begin their battle.
 More matches have passed and now it’s time for match sixteen, Ikose, age 14, versus Goten, age 7. Idasam yells at him to not be careless like his brother. Chi-Chi yells at Goten to go easy on him. The lady gets pissed that there""s another vulgar woman with a ""shit brat"" for a kid, and Bulma makes fun of her sons. Goten bows before his opponent, and Ikose thinks he's such a hick. At the same time the announcer thinks this Goten must certainly be Goku's son, since they look so much alike. The match begins and Goten effortlessly blocks all of Ikose's moves, and tells him to get serious. So, Ikose tries a bit harder, but Goten still blocks it all effortlessly, then gets bored and knocks him out with a single punch. His mother gets pissed and tries to attack Bulma, but Chi-Chi knocks her out.
 Videl says it sounds like Goten won his match, but Gohan isn't too enthused, so she thinks he doesn't care. Meanwhile, Goten and Trunks each blaze through the competition, until it comes down to the two of them in the finals. The announcer says not only are they both very strong, but they're friends. An attendant tells Mr. Satan there are two very strong kids in the finals, and so he decides to go watch after all. Krillin and Goku are glad they’ll finally see a good match, as Videl and Gohan join them in the stands. The match begins, and Trunks and Goten promise to not go easy on each other. As he watches on, Mr. Satan thinks Goten looks very familiar.
 The two young Saiyan warriors rush at each other, blocking each other's strikes, and then break. But they fly right back at each other, into the air, and exchange punches, eventually punching each other in the face. Goten hits at a few of Trunks' Afterimages, then Trunks hits at Goten's afterimage, and they exchange more mid-air blows, until they finally break away and land back in the ring. The audience is stunned, especially Mr. Satan. But Goku and Krillin think they're doing great, and some of the audience starts to get quite excited as well.
"
"Trunks vs. Goten, Part 2",434 (DBZ 240),"The cover shows the beginning scenes of the chapter where it shows Trunks and Goten in fighting stance on the arena during their match in the Junior Division of the World Martial Arts Tournament.
 The crowd thinks this is a really awesome fight, and a TV producer frets about the lack of available TV cameras, or even spectators' home video cameras, to capture this incredible fight. The announcer loves it, as this is how the World Martial Arts Tournament is supposed to be. Trunks says Goten has improved, and Goten says his brother taught him lots of things. But Trunks wonders if he can do this, and begins focusing ki both of his hands. Gohan and Krillin worry that a ki blast from there will hit the audience, but Goku knows better. Trunks then brings both hands together to fire a single blast. Goten floats up to dodge it, and Trunks maneuvers it just in time to keep it from hitting the audience. The crowd says it looked like he shot rockets from his hands, while Mr. Satan recognizes this kind of thing…
 Goten, on the ground again, says he just learned how to do that, too. Goten's Kamekameha shoots straight at Trunks, but Trunks leans to the side, and the announcer has to duck for cover, as it shoots toward the backstage building, taking off a small chunk of its roof. Goten giggles nervously about that, as Mr. Satan says it's just like that guy from the battle with Cell. Trunks says ki blasts are too dangerous and they should stop. Meanwhile, Videl is quite shocked to have seen all this. The hand-to-hand battle resumes, and Trunks flies at Goten, with Goten reciprocating, until they clash and grasp each other by the shoulders. Trunks tosses Goten into the air, and Goten catches himself, but loses sight of Trunks.
 Trunks suddenly grabs Goten from behind, locking him in a Full-Nelson. Trunks insists that he give up, but Goten refuses. Goten is really struggling, and Vegeta tells Goku that Trunks is winning. Goten suddenly turns Super Saiyan to break free, and they both land in the ring, where Goten returns to normal again. Trunks scolds Goten for that, and he nervously giggles and apologizes. Videl is bug-eyed, Gohan is angry, and Goku is shocked he can go Super Saiyan. Vegeta yells at Goku that that was a dirty trick, but Goku says he had nothing to do with it. Mr. Satan nervously then figures out that Goten is Goku's son.
"
The Winner!,435 (DBZ 241),"Trunks says he can win without using his left hand, but Goten doesn't believe him. Trunks then flies forward, hitting with his right arm only, but Goten blocks it and then kicks him in the face. Goten blocks another hit and punches Trunks in the face, and they break away. Trunks shoots a small blast toward Goten, but it hits the ring as Goten flies up into the air. Goten composes himself and then dives straight down at Trunks. Trunks realizes what he's planning, and decides to hold still, until he jumps out of the way at the last moment. Goten manages to fly after Trunks instead of crashing into the ring, and so Trunks turns Super Saiyan in desperation and blasts Goten in the back using his left hand. The little blast knocks Goten into the audience. Ring out, Trunks wins!
 Goten goes back to the ring and yells at Trunks for cheating. Not just for going Super Saiyan, but he used his left hand, too. Trunks says Goten had used Super Saiyan as well, and he didn't directly hit him with his left hand. Goku is surprised Trunks can become a Super Saiyan as well, but Vegeta just laughs about his son being better. Trunks tells Goten he can have three of his toys, which makes Goten happy again. The announcer comes into the ring, saying that up next is the special attraction fight against the world champion, Mr. Satan, who is standing backstage and absolutely speechless.
"
Hercule's Courage!,436 (DBZ 242),"With Trunks' victory over Goten, he's earned the right to fight Hercule. Hercule is terrorized at the thought of fighting such a strong kid, but manages to keep up his facade for the crowd. Trunks isn't impressed by Hercule's strength, and Goten cheers for Trunks to give his best, which Hercule yells at him for.
 Goku, Krillin, Piccolo, Vegeta, and Android 18 walk off, knowing this fight is going to be as one sided as it gets. Gohan chooses to stay, since Videl is shocked they don't want to watch Trunks fight Hercule. Back in the ring, Hercule shows off for the crowd, still leaving Trunks unimpressed. Trunks says he's bringing everything, scaring Hercule again. Hercule tells him it's just a game and not to act so immature and childish, but Trunks reminds Hercule that he's supposed to be immature and childish, since he's just a kid.
 Hercule suddenly drops, clutching his knee and claiming an old knee injury he got during the fight with Cell is acting up again. When the World Tournament Announcer offers to call the doctor over, Hercule stands up, claiming it's better now. Hercule knows he can't beat Trunks, but his reputation will be ruined if he loses to a kid.
 Hercule finally hits on an idea though. Calling Trunks over, he makes up a story about a ""special pre-fight greeting"" of tapping each other's faces with their fists. When the fight begins, Hercule walks over to Trunks and sticks his face out, looking like he's giving Trunks a free hit. His plan is to take the tap from Trunks then throw himself out of the ring, to make it look like he lost the fight on purpose. Trunks' ""light tap,"" however, still launches Hercule clear out of the ring to slam into the wall.
 Despite this however, Hercule manages to stand up and play the act of losing on purpose. This convinces the crowd, which gets them laughing. Hercule manages to keep a straight face until he gets back to his room, at which point, he collapses, clutching his face in pain.
"
The Mysterious Duo,437 (DBZ 243),"The announcer says that the Adult Division will begin at 1:40 PM, after a thirty-minute intermission. Krillin suggests they get some food in the meantime. An attendant stops them and says only those who've passed the preliminaries can pass, but Krillin insists they've passed. Their names are Krillin, Goku, No. 18, Vegeta, and Ma Junior. Goku asks about ""Ma Junior"", and Piccolo says that ""Piccolo"" might be unpleasant. They're allowed through, with the attendant telling them that the match order drawing will be at 1:30. Krillin says that only them and Gohan will be any good, and Goku doesn't have any use for prize money right now. Krillin says he doesn't even age while he's dead, and Goku asks if he wants to try it. Krillin says he's incredibly happy now, so he'll pass on the offer.
 Trunks calls Goten over, and they're looking at an adult participant wearing a mask. Trunks says he's passed the preliminaries if he's over there, and thinks they can ""use"" him. They could fit into his clothes, and then fight with the adults dressed as him. Goten says they can't, but Trunks insists, and then runs over to the guy. Trunks tells the guy a pretty girl wanted to talk to him, and leads him behind a building, then knocks him out. They take off his clothes, and Goten thinks they're too small for these. That's why they'll both wear it. Trunks sits on Goten's shoulders, and then they put on the outfit, and voila! Goten pokes eye holes through the shirt so he can see, too. And then they run off looking quite odd.
 Meanwhile, Goku and Vegeta are chowing down on plate after plate of food, as everyone else watches on after finishing. Krillin wonders if it’s okay to eat so much, doubting that dead people even get hungry. Goku says it doesn't matter if you eat or not in Other World, and says the food of the lower world is much yummier. Gohan and Videl arrive, and Gohan joins in eating a lot, too. Krillin wonders about Saiyan stomachs. After finishing up all their food, they head back and Gohan asks Videl if she didn't eat because she's on a diet, but she says nothing. As they walk around, they bump into a strange pair.
 A very tall solemn man, and a small little guy with spiked hair, who's floating. Piccolo and Goku are speechless, as Videl comments on the floating. The little guy says hello to Goku, explaining that he's heard of him. He has also passed the preliminaries, and hopes to fight against Goku. He doubts he could beat Goku, but he'd love to find out how strong he really is. Then he wants to shake Goku's hand. They shake, and the guy says Goku does indeed have a good soul. The pair heads off, and Goku thinks it won't be so easy for them to win after all. Krillin didn't think anything special of them, though.
"
The Finalists are Chosen!,438 (DBZ 244),"Piccolo doubts those two were from Earth, but wonders why aliens would be here. Videl asks about this alien business, and Gohan whispers to her that Piccolo's a bit strange, and she believes him because of his complexion. Krillin wants the drawing to hurry up and start. They continue on toward the backstage area and arrive just in time for the drawings. Krillin prays to God that he doesn't fight any of his friends in the first round, and Piccolo says God is Dende. Goku looks around, and doesn't think anyone but the pair from before look great. He wonders about the two guys with the ""M"" on their foreheads, and thinks Mighty Mask looks weird.
 The announcer says he'll call them all in (Japanese) alphabetical order. The drawing begins and Killa draws #14, Kibito draws #7, Krillin draws #1, Gohan draws #8 to put him up against Kibito, Android 18 draws #9, and Shin draws #3. Trunks asks Goten if they know the masked guy's name, but he doesn't. Spopovich gets called up, but doesn't respond, so Trunks and Goten think that must be their name, and run up. The announcer tells them they're Mighty Mask, as the real Spopovich comes up and angrily draws #6. Jewel draws next and draws #16, with Goku drawing #11 after him. Videl is called up and she asks about her dad, and the announcer says that he's resting so he'll draw in his place. Videl draws #5, putting her up against Spopovich. Overhearing this, Goku realizes that she's Mr. Satan's daughter, and Krillin asks Gohan when they're getting married. Pintar draws #2, and Krillin is relieved to fight him. Vegeta draws #12... putting him up against Goku! Vegeta has been waiting a long time for this day. Trunks and Goten argue about whose father will win, as they get called up and draw #13, against Killa. Piccolo draws #4, putting him up against Shin. The announcer then draws for Mr. Satan, getting #10, putting him up against 18. Finally, Yamu draws #15, putting him up against Jewel. The match-ups are set!
 The announcer leads them all to the waiting room, going over the rules again. There is also now a thirty-minute time limit per match, due to the increased number of matches. Pintar says he'll only need ten seconds to beat Krillin, who merely scoffs. The announcer then goes out and announces the start of the World Martial Arts Tournament. An attendant tells Mr. Satan (who is still recovering) that he'll be in the fifth match, and his opponent is an unknown, yet beautiful girl. Mr. Satan sits up excitedly.
"
The First Two Fights,439 (DBZ 245),"The announcer reads off the results for those who can't see, with Yamcha noting that Goku will be fighting Vegeta. The first match will begin right away — Krillin vs. Pintar. The announcer tells the crowd that Krillin used to compete when he was a kid and did very well, while Puntar had competed at the previous tournament and lost by ring out in the semifinals. Marron says the man her father's fighting looks really big and strong, but Yamcha assures her that her father is the strongest in the world, of the Earthlings at least. Puntar says he won't hold back, because the World Martial Arts Tournament isn't a game, although then he mockingly says that tiny-geezers don't belong here, either. Krillin sighs and thinks he won't use his full strength against this idiot.
 The match begins and Puntar starts flipping around the ring to show off that not only is he big, but he's also fast, telling Krillin he won't be able to run away. He dares Krillin to punch him, and so Krillin nonchalantly punches him in the gut, smacks him across the face, and then kicks him out of the ring. The announcer is happy to see such strength again, and calls for the second match to begin — Shin vs. Ma Junior. The announcer says that this is Shin's first time competing, but Ma Junior had gotten to the finals at an old tournament, in an incredible fight that he remembers very well. The announcer asks him not to destroy the ring (again). Some people in the crowd recognize Piccolo as one of the people in the way while Mr. Satan fought Cell. Backstage, Vegeta is thinking they'll finally get to see just how great this guy's power really is.
 The forfeit of Piccolo Piccolo realizes he can't fight this person, and wonders why. Shin tells him he'll know soon enough but for now, let's make this a fun game. Piccolo is shocked his thoughts have been read, and then concedes and leaves the ring. Shin thinks, ""I see. He used to be this planet's god… Somehow or other, he's beginning to sense who I am…"" Shin gets the victory, and Piccolo tells Goku their difference in strength was dimensions apart. Krillin starts to worry, since he'll have to fight him in the next round. But now for the third match — Videl vs. Spopovich. The crowd chants for Videl, and Gohan wishes her good luck. The announcer tells the crowd that Videl is Mr. Satan's daughter, as well as a friend of justice who has foiled many criminals for the police. She also won the Youth Division seven years ago at the previous tournament, when she was a little girl. Spopovich competed at the last tournament, but now he’s come back and changed his image. Shin passes Spopovich on his way backstage, and glances back at him with grave concern.
"
Shin's Surprise,440 (DBZ 246),"The match between Videl and Spopovich is about to begin. As the crowd wildly cheers for Videl, Shin continues to glare at Spopovich before returning to the waiting area. Killa and Jewel can't help but notice how much Spopovich has changed since the last tournament.
 In the Waiting Room, Piccolo asks Shin if he's the Grand Kai. Shin denies this, but then Kibito reveals that he's actually the Supreme Kai. Piccolo is stunned by this, but Shin asks him to keep it quiet. Goku asks if Shin was trash talking, and if he wanted him put in his place. Piccolo quickly tells Goku to not say anything. In Other World, even King Kai is surprised that the Supreme Kai would come to Earth.
 Back in the ring, Videl is laying a beatdown on Spopovich, easily knocking him around. However, no matter how many hits she lands, Spopovich just keeps coming. Gohan is stunned by this, and even Goku realizes something is wrong.
"
Videl... Battered,441 (DBZ 247),"The fight between Videl and Spopovich is starting to turn against Videl. She gets smacked around by Spopovich, then nearly kicked out of the ring. However, Videl manages to catch herself and fly back into the ring without landing out of bounds. Gohan is happy that Videl's using the lessons he taught her, but Goku is still realizing something's wrong with Spopovich: He's barely fazed for the damage he's taken, and Goku can't feel his Ki at all.
 Videl comes in with a powerful kick that ends up turning Spopovich's head all the way around, seemingly breaking his neck and killing him. However, Spopovich just grabs his head and forces it back into place, stunning the World Tournament Announcer, the crowd and Videl. Spopovich takes advantage of Videl's shock with a powerful punch to her face, but Videl manages to fly up and dodge his next one.
 Spopovich, however, shocks everyone by flying up after her, something Killa and Jewel know he wasn't able to do before. Spopovich then knocks Videl back to the ring with a Ki Blast. Krillin notes it didn't have much power, but Vegeta knows he weakened it on purpose because killing your opponent would result in a loss. Spopovich goes back to pounding on Videl. The crowd is starting to become filled with horror, and even Gohan is begging Videl to give up the fight.
"
Gohan Gets Mad!!,442 (DBZ 248),"Spopovich continues to batter Videl. Despite the pleas of the crowd, Gohan, and even the World Tournament Announcer, Videl refuses to concede defeat, giving Spopovich a desperate kick to the face, which does little damage. Spopovich then resumes battering Videl.
 Gohan is starting to get angry, while Goku tries to get him to calm down. When Spopovich threatens to crush Videl's head under his foot, however, Gohan can't hold back anymore and transforms into his Super Saiyan form, blowing off his bandana and ripping off his cape. Before he can charge out, however, Yamu intervenes, telling Spopovich to stop fooling around and end the fight already, since this isn't what they set out to do.
 Spopovich proceeds to drag Videl out of the ring, mercifully ending the match at last. Gohan reverts to his base form, and runs out to help Videl, but not before warning Spopovich that he'll pay for what he did to Videl. Goku quickly uses Instant Transmission to head for Korin Tower to get some Senzu Beans. Meanwhile, Gohan takes VIdel to the infirmary, where Mr. Satan arrives shortly thereafter to check on her. Gohan promises to beat Spopovich for Videl. Hercule, hearing this, worries that his daughter is dating a ""wuss"" like Gohan.
 At Korin Tower, Korin gives Goku a bag of senzu beans, and warns Goku that he has a bad feeling about what's coming next...
"
The Plot of the Lords,443 (DBZ 249),"
 The announcer informs the crowd that Videl's life is not in danger, and starts to announce the fourth match, but Gohan rushes out to ask him to wait a little bit because they're getting a special medicine for Videl. Goku then returns, with three Senzu Beans (that's all Korin had), and Gohan asks Kibito to hold on for just a bit longer while he helps Videl. Gohan goes into the medical room and tells Videl to eat this bean, but the doctor protests him giving weird food to his patients. Videl says that since it's Gohan, something strange will probably happen. Mr. Satan tells her not to listen to him and spit that out, but she chews it anyway. Gohan has to leave for his match now, and Mr. Satan thinks he'll really make that kid suffer. Videl's eyes suddenly widen and she sits up in astonishment, fully healed. She stands up, excited, while Mr. Satan and the doctor are in complete shock.
 Great Saiyaman reveals he is Gohan The fourth match is about to begin, with Great Saiyaman vs Kibito. Erasa and Sharpner recognize that name as Satan City's friend of justice, and their classmate looks through his binoculars and says that looks just like Gohan. Sharpner looks through them to see for himself, and agrees. Erasa figures Gohan's just borrowing that name to compete in secret, because he is so shy. Sharpner wonders if he knows how to fight, while the other kid says they should cheer for him, hopeless as it may be. Gohan realizes he's been completely exposed after realizing for all of that trouble making his disguise, and sighs as he tosses away his sunglasses.
 The match begins, but Gohan is worried about the fuss that will be caused if the kids at school know how strong he is, especially since Kibito doesn't look like a very easy opponent. But his worries quickly vanish when Kibito asks him to turn into that Super Saiyan thing, it could really help them. Gohan wants to know how he knows about Super Saiyan, and what does he mean by ""help us"". Kibito says he'll know soon enough. Gohan is hesitant to transform in front of this crowd, though. Backstage, Yamu asks about them, and Spopovich, holding a weird looking meter says nope, their energy is low. Piccolo yells out to Gohan, and Goku asks Piccolo if something is wrong. He doesn't know, but… Shin interrupts him, and apologizes, but they need to use Gohan. And no matter what happens, all of them must stay here and not interfere. Gohan decides to do it, thinking he'll just have to give up school. Vegeta says he won't listen to someone he doesn't even know, but Piccolo tells them this is Supreme Kai, god of all the Kais. Everyone is shocked to hear this, and Goku says he has heard of him. Meanwhile, the crowd is growing restless that they're not fighting, but then Gohan starts to power up.
"
The Stolen Energy,444 (DBZ 250),"
 Gohan turns Super Saiyan 2 The crowd is getting restless, but Chi-Chi yells at them to shut up, he's obviously gonna do something awesome. Krillin asks Supreme Kai what will happen when Gohan transforms. Supreme Kai thinks Spopovich and Yamu may attack Gohan and doesn't want anyone to help him as they just want strong energy. Goku is curious what he means by energy. Back in the ring, Gohan says he'll turn Super Saiyan, even though he doesn't know why. In fact, he'll go even further and go over the wall of Super Saiyan. Kibito is shocked to hear there's something beyond Super Saiyan. Gohan ramps it up and transforms all the way up to that stage, shocking everyone. Even Videl sees this, and wonders what's going on. Spopovich's meter is going off the scale, and he says this guy has tremendous energy. Gohan asks if he wants to fight now, but Kibito can't believe that someone of the lower world could have such incredible power.
 Vegeta thinks he's not nearly at the level he was fighting Cell since he's slacked off on his training during these peaceful times. But Supreme Kai says his power is already well beyond imagination, and wonders what would happen if that power ""stopped"". Sharpner and Erasa suddenly realize Gohan is the Golden Warrior, while other people in the stands remember seeing guys like that when Mr. Satan was fighting Cell. Yamu now has another little device with an ""M"" on it, shaped like a turkey baster. The two of them fly into the ring, and Gohan sense them right away. He turns to take on the attackers, but Supreme Kai suddenly throws out his hands, using his power to bind Gohan still. Spopovich restrains Gohan, as Yamu uses the device to suck away Gohan's energy. Once the device is full, Yamu and Spopovich fly off, and Gohan collapses.
 Supreme Kai tells them not to do anything, as Kibito will return Gohan to normal. He then decides to follow them and asked the others if they come with him for help. The crowd is very confused, while Chi-Chi is worried about Gohan. Krillin asks Goku what to do. Goku of course wants to follow, to help out Supreme Kai, and to finally find out what's going on.
"
The Terrible Mystery,445 (DBZ 251),"
 As they fly along with Gohan's stolen energy, Yamu thinks they can revive Majin Buu and Babidi will be very pleased as well. Supreme Kai is in pursuit, from a safe distance. Back at the tournament grounds, Videl rushes over to Gohan, as Krillin says he'll go with Goku, but first he'll tell his wife. Vegeta tells Kakarrot not to screw with him; what about their fight? Vegeta doesn't care about Supreme Kai or whatever, he just wants to settle their score, one-on-one. That's the only reason he came to this stupid tournament. Goku says they can fight afterwards, but Vegeta reminds him that he's only here for one day. Goku suggests to Vegeta that he should come with them just in case. Piccolo is the first to fly off, and Goku goes to make sure Kibito will take care of Gohan. With Kibito's assurance, Goku flies off as well, followed by a reluctant Vegeta. Android 18 says she's staying here so she can get the prize money. Kuririn tells her not to kill anyone, and No. 18 tells him to run away if it seems too dangerous, as he flies off.
 Videl asks Kibito where everyone went, and he says she'll know if she goes. Some doctors come to help Gohan, but Kibito tells them to shut up and watch. He puts his hand on Gohan's chest, and begins healing him, contemplating all this unfathomable power and pure energy Gohan has. Goten and Trunks are watching from a roof, wondering what was up with Gohan, and why everyone flew off. Gohan is finally fully healed, and Kibito says he'll tell him everything if he comes with him, and then flies off. Mr. Satan notices that Videl is with that kid again, and gets pissed. Videl wants to go too, but Gohan says only if she promises to run away if things get dangerous. Gohan and Videl then fly off. Satan sees this, and says that Videl has become a hikō girl. (Hikō means ""flying"", but also ""delinquent"". It's a very bad pun.) Bulma, Chi-Chi, and Yamcha wonder where everyone went, and the announcer is worried about the World Martial Arts Tournament.
 Piccolo, Vegeta, Goku, and Krillin all catch up to Supreme Kai, who grateful for their help. Goku wonders if he can't those two but Supreme Kai tells him they're just being used by a sly mage. Long ago, when humanity had just begun to walk on two feet on Earth… Far off in space, there was a very evil mage named Bibbidi. One day, Bibbidi unintentionally created an incredible monster. A majin called ""Buu"". Majin Buu had no reason or emotion. He did nothing but destroy and massacre repeatedly. He was a monster born only to bring terror. In a matter of years, hundreds of planets were turned into planets of death. Vegeta thinks that the Saiyans did the same thing. Supreme Kai tells him there were five Supreme Kais back then, who all held ability to defeat someone like Frieza. Vegeta is shocked to realize he read his thoughts. Four of those Supreme Kais were killed by Majin Buu, who's ferocity was controlled only by Bibbidi and temporarily sealed away Majin Buu when he needed a rest.
 Meanwhile, Kibito is telling the same story to Gohan and Videl. Bibbidi brought the sealed up Majin Buu to Earth, because that was his next target. Supreme Kai was waiting for this chance. And so, before Buu's seal was released, he was able to kill Bibbidi. The ball in which Majin Buu is sealed has remained sealed, without being destroyed. They thought it best to not unnecessarily disturb it. Moreover, the only one who could release the seal was the Mage Bibbidi. However, just recently, they learned something terrible. Supreme Kai finishes the story: ""The Mage Bibbidi had a child with an evil heart, just like him. The mage Babidi"".
"
Bobbidi the Warlock,446 (DBZ 252),"The cover depicts Babidi, with Dabura standing behind him.
 As the pursuit of Spopovich and Yamu continues, Shin explains that the only way to stop Majin Buu's revival is to stop Babidi. Further back, Kibito explains that, in order to resurrect Buu, Babidi needed a lot of pure energy. He then admits they knew Spopovich and Yamu would attack Gohan when he transformed into a Super Saiyan, but they needed the attack to occur so they could follow Spopovich and Yamu and find where Majin Buu was hidden. When Goku asks Shin why they just left Majin Buu where they did, Shin says they had no choice, since they couldn't risk breaking Majin Buu's seal.
 Kibito says they should speed up if they want to catch up, but Videl can't fly any faster. Gohan tells her to turn back, since this is going to me more dangerous than he thought. Videl takes this opportunity to ask if Gohan really was the Gold Fighter, which Gohan confirms and he apologizes to Videl for lying to her. Videl goes on to ask if he was the kid back at the Cell Games, which Gohan again confirms. Videl discovers that Gohan is the true hero who defeated Cell and is happy she now knows the truth about her father's story, and tells Gohan to give Babidi what he deserves and wishes Gohan good luck. Kibito and Gohan turn up the speed and fly off, leaving Videl behind as Videl tells Gohan that when he comes back, she'll ask to go on a date with him.
 Just as Kibito and Gohan catch up with the others, Shin sees that Spopovich and Yamu are landing. The group lands on a nearby hill, and suppress their Ki so they aren't detected. They watch as Spopovich and Yamu talk to someone, and realize that Babidi had hidden his spaceship underground, which likely means Babidi knows Shin and Kibito are there.
 Babidi and Dabura Piccolo suggests they strike before they get a chance to resurrect Majin Buu, but Shin advises them to be patient, waiting for them to come out. Gohan glances off to the side and spots a slaughter family, angering him. Just then, Piccolo sees someone coming out of the ship. This ""someone"" turns out to be two someones... the Warlock Babidi and his greatest minion, the Demon King Dabura!
"
The Evil Masters,447 (DBZ 253),"
 Kibito and Supreme Kai freak out that Babidi has taken control of Dabura, king of the Demon Realm. Goku asks if he's the big guy, and Supreme Kai says yes. He explains that he's the king of the Dark Demon Realm. In this world, they may be the strongest, but in the Demon World, Dabura is the top. Krillin starts to get worried, as Gohan realizes the smaller one must be the Mage Babidi. Supreme Kai says he has little strength, but he uses fierce magic, enough to make even Dabura his underling. It's not just that his magic is powerful enough to enslave really strong people, Babidi takes advantage of the evil in one's heart and controls them via their thoughts. Thus, Dabura was a suitable choice. That's why only people like them without evil in their hearts can fight Babidi.
 Supreme Kai says they really hadn't counted on Dabura being here, and Vegeta asks if they think they can't win. Vegeta says this Majin Buu won't be revived, because he won’t lose to guys like this. Goku tells Krillin he should leave, and Krillin agrees. Meanwhile, Babidi says the energy device is full, and is fairly close to the amount they need to revive Majin Buu. But now he doesn't need those two anymore, and Babidi suddenly makes Spopovich swell up until he explodes. Yamu tries to run away, but Pui-Pui takes care of this by firing a blast at Yamu, killing him on the spot. Babidi says he's noticed they had brought along lots of ""bait"", including his father's killer, Supreme Kai. Dabura figures they intend to hide, noting that there's seven of them. They can't use Supreme Kai or Kibito's energy, but three of the others have wonderful energy.
"
The Descent,448 (DBZ 254),"
 Dabura flies up to Kibito, puts his hand to his face, and fires a ki blast at him, killing him. Dabura then spits at Krillin and Piccolo, who were unable to react to Supreme Kai's warning about his saliva and they're both turned to stone. Goku asks if there's a way to turn them back, and Supreme Kai says only if Dabura dies. Goku is glad it’s such a simple method. Dabura flies back into the ship, and Goku and Gohan agree to follow. Supreme Kai yells at them that it's exactly what the enemy wants, but Vegeta says they're no good at waiting, and follows as well. Supreme Kai reluctantly goes after them. The four of them enter the door, and fly down a long shaft, until they come to a large round room.
 Supreme Kai tells them that the only way out of the ship is to defeat Babidi. Vegeta thinks he could just destroy the ship, but Supreme Kai protests, as a strong shock could wake up Majin Buu. Even without full energy, Majin Buu could kill all of them and destroy the Earth in a short time. Babidi is watching through a crystal ball, and tells Pui-Pui to go take their energy. Pui-Pui enters the room where they're waiting and tells them that Babidi is on the lowest floor. However, they won't get past him. Goku thinks otherwise, though.
"
Stage One: Pocus,449 (DBZ 255),"
 Babidi injects the Energy-Suction Device into the shell containing Majin Buu. Babidi, however, ends up getting a shock, as the single injection has given them almost half the energy they need to revive Majin Buu. He starts to wonder if maybe he was a bit too hasty in eliminating Spopovich and Yamu, but Dabura reassures him that the energy of the fools they lured into the ship will finish the job. Babidi, reassured, flies back up to see if Pui Pui had finished yet, but is taken aback because the fighting hasn't even started yet.
 And the reason is because Goku, Gohan, and Vegeta are playing Rock-Paper-Scissors to see who gets first crack at Pui Pui. In the end, Vegeta wins the game, and steps up to fight Pui Pui. Pui Pui reveals that, if they take any damage, it will be converted to energy for Majin Buu. Vegeta just smirks, asking if they don't get any damage if he doesn't get hurt. Pui Pui acknowledges this, but calls it unlikely. Vegeta just tells him to start the fight, then.
 Pui Pui charges Vegeta with a kick, but Vegeta easily blocks it and counters with a kick of his own, slamming Pui Pui into the wall. Pui Pui pushes himself up, and right into Vegeta kicking him upward into the ceiling. It quickly becomes obvious that Pui Pui is no match for Vegeta, which surprised both Babidi and Shin. Babidi, knowing Pui Pui needs an edge, uses his Paparapapa magic to transport them to Pui Pui's home world of Zoon.
 Pui Pui now thinks the advantage is his, because the gravity of Planet Zoon is ten times that of Earth, but Vegeta, having trained in gravity levels far higher than ten times, is completely unfazed. He rapidly zips over to Pui Pui and annihilates him with a Double Galick Cannon. The ease of which Vegeta destroyed Pui Pui comes as another shock to Shin and Babidi, who never imagined they were this powerful. With the defeat of Pui Pui, they can proceed to the next stage.
"
Stage Two: Yakon,450 (DBZ 256),"
 Dabura asks who he wants fighting on Stage Two and Babidi tells him Yakon, since it seems they can't fool around with these Earthlings. Dabura is worried that he'll never get to have any fun if they send Yakon out, but Babidi lectures him that awakening Majin Buu from his long sleep is much more important than fun. Goku is getting impatient, while Vegeta contemplates just destroying the floor, but Supreme Kai insists he mustn't, lest he disturb Majin Buu. Vegeta thinks this Majin Buu is probably nothing special, just like Dabura. Goku agrees, thinking Dabura is probably about as strong as Cell was seven years ago. Supreme Kai can't believe the power of these Super Saiyans.
 Goku says to come on and hurry up, but just then the door in front of him opens and his opponent steps out. Yakon is a big frog-like monster, and wants to know who he'll be eating first. Goku says he’s his opponent. Supreme Kai recognizes the beast Yakon, but before he can say anything Yakon punches at Goku, with Goku just barely jumping out of the way. Yakon then swipes at him with one of his claws, and manages to slash Goku's outer shirt. Gohan notes that he's not only huge, but fast too, and reassures Supreme Kai that his father can handle this alone.
 Bobbidi praises Yakon, and tells him to hurry up and finish this and take their energy. To end things quickly, he’ll send them to Yakon's beloved pitch-dark world, the Planet of Darkness. Dabura thinks that's unnecessary, but Babidi says he doesn’t want the ship to take a great shock, and accidentally have Majin Buu be revived at less than full power. So, ""Paparapapa!!!"" The room is now pitch black, and Goku can't see a thing, but Yakon can. Yakon swipes his large claws at Goku, but Goku dodges and then kicks Yakon in the face. Yakon is shocked, but Goku says he can sense his movements even in total darkness, because of the flow of air and his energy. Although, he does have a method of seeing him, and so he turns Super Saiyan, illuminating the entire surrounding area. Babidi and Dabura wonder what this is.
"
Yakon's Treat,451 (DBZ 257),"
 Goku vs. Yakon Babidi wonders what happened, saying his aura is different from before, but Dabura thinks he's just glowing. Babidi tells a nearby henchman to go get him the strongest energy measuring device there is. Back on Stage Two, Goku informs Yakon that it's futile even in total darkness. Yakon chuckles and says he understands very well. Goku wonders why he doesn't seem shocked. The device says Goku has a reading of 3,000 Kili, and Dabura says a race with a 3,000 kili reading should not exist. Babidi considers that the device is malfunctioning, but if it's right, Yakon's energy is only 800 kili. Yakon suddenly opens his mouth and begins sucking the Super Saiyan aura off of Goku in a big ball of light, and swallows it. Goku is back to normal again, and no one can see anymore.
 Everyone wonders what happened, and Supreme Kai remembers that the beast Yakon eats light energy. Goku's Super Saiyan energy must be a great meal for him. Yakon says that was good, he's never eaten light of such delicious volume before. Gohan yells out to his father to not become a Super Saiyan anymore, because he eats light energy. Yakon confirms this, but he would still love to have another serving of that great light. Goku decides to give it to him, and transforms again. Supreme Kai thinks he's really stupid, but Vegeta assures him he has something planned. Yakon starts sucking away his aura again, and Goku has trouble maintaining his transformation. Babidi yells at Yakon that he's stupid to be sucking up the energy, instead of inflicting damage so that the energy can be absorbed by Majin Buu.
 Goku then suddenly increases his energy and for a brief moment turns super saiyan 2 and Yakon sucks it all up, until he gets too large and explodes. Goku is exhausted now, as the floor panel opens up. Vegeta thinks, ""So, that Kakarrot bastard has also climbed over the wall… The Super Saiyan wall…"" As they fly down the hole to the next stage, Gohan says his father had such an incredible ki when he defeated that monster. Babidi can't believe Yakon exploded, but Dabura says he was just a fool to eat more light energy than he could handle. Babidi disagrees, because of the way that Yakon swelled up near the end. Babidi thinks those guys aren't normal, and so Dabura volunteers to handle Stage Three personally. Babidi worries about Dabura losing but Dabura reminds him that as the king of the Demon Realm no one can stand up to his power.
"
Battle Royale,452 (DBZ 258),"The cover of this chapter shows Dabura ready to attack in the foreground, and Gohan, Majin Buu's Sealed Ball and Babidi in the background. This cover art is also featured in Daizenshuu 1.
 Goku wonders if Gohan's trained enough, since his turn is next. Vegeta says, ""Unfortunately, it seems as though he hasn’t trained a whole lot because of this peace. Now, it seems that we’re the ones with the greater power. Although you never know what would happen if he could go mad and kick some ass."" Supreme Kai really can't believe their power, nor that he, Supreme Kai, is so flustered about them. Then suddenly the door begins to open and Dabura enters the room, praising them on defeating Yakon and making it to Stage Three. But this is as far as they go. Vegeta says Babidi must be getting desperate to send him out so soon. Dabura chuckles and tells them to bring it on, but Gohan says it’s his turn and he'll be the one to defeat Dabura. Dabura and Babidi both get a little irked at his confidence.
 Meanwhile, back at the World Martial Arts Tournament the announcer says that most of the competitors have left, and since such a thing is unprecedented, they're currently discussing how to proceed. The officials think that it’s been almost an hour now, but they only have five competitors left… In the audience, Master Roshi wonders what's going on, as he feels some large ki gathering far away. Backstage, Mr. Satan says everyone left because they were scared of him, and the remaining contestants must be truly brave. Then Mr. Satan gets an idea and heads outside, appealing to the crowd as he walks to talk to the officials. A battle royal, all five of them in the ring fighting. The officials are a bit hesitant, but they eventually agree to Satan's proposal and the announcer explains the idea to the crowd.
 An official tells Satan he's really brave, since the four others will likely gang up on him. Mr. Satan begins to worry, as he hadn’t thought of that possibility. The announcer starts to call out the competitors. First, the champion whom they all know, Mr. Satan. The only female, Android 18, with the weird name. Mighty Mask, who lost in the first round of the last tournament. Killa, who made it to the semifinals of the last tournament. And Jewel, who is popular with the ladies, but lost to Mr. Satan in the finals of the last tournament. Killa asks Mighty Mask if they could team up against Mr. Satan, but Mighty Mask says No. 18 is the only one he's worried about. Jewel starts to flirt with No. 18, but she calls him an eyesore, telling him to get lost.
 The match is called to begin, and Mr. Satan starts to psych himself up for the battle. However, Jewel tries to attack No. 18 first, because she offended him, but she calmly kicks him out of the ring. Mighty Mask then punches Killa out of the ring as well. Satan is glad, since these remaining two don't seem like much. No. 18 thinks that Mighty Mask hits awfully hard, for someone with such small arms. Trunks reminds Goten that No. 18 used to be stronger than their dads. Mr. Satan calls the two of them on, but they ignore him.
"
Mighty Mask Shows His Power!,453 (DBZ 259),"
 Mr. Satan thinks he'll use a flashy technique to take out the masked bastard, which will frighten the pretty girl, and he'll proceed to gently push her out of the ring. Mr. Satan calls on Mighty Mask, and heads toward ""him"" using his Rolling Attack. Then he attempts to use a Satan Punch, but Mighty Mask flies toward Android 18, and the two begin exchanging blows while Mr. Satan is left confused. Trunks and Goten have a little trouble holding themselves against No. 18, and head up into the air, but she follows. Trunks and Goten are rather clumsy fighting together under their outfit, and No. 18 flies above them and hammers them back down into the ring, where they crash hard. But they get up, and Trunks tells Goten to try kicking.
 No. 18 fires a blast down at them, and they just barely fly out of the way, losing their boots in the process. Goten suggests they go Super Saiyan, and Trunks agrees that they won't be discovered in these clothes. They transform, but No. 18 notices their aura. Trunks thinks they should try a Kiaihō as No. 18 begins to realize who they are. The two boys fire off a huge blast together, which actually scares No. 18, but she dodges it and it explodes off in the surrounding ocean. No. 18 is really shocked by the incredible speed and destructive power of that ""energy bomb"". She decides to end this soon, and throws an Energy Disc at the boys. They both try to avoid it by flying opposite directions and the disc cuts their outfit in half, separating the two of them. The boys fly away, as the announcer says they're disqualified for fighting as teams. No. 18 lands back in the ring, and Mr. Satan thinks he's gonna die.
"
We Have a Winner!!,454 (DBZ 260),"
 
 The crowd is chanting “SATAN” and “EIGHTEEN”, as the announcer goes on about them being the final two contestants, but Mr. Satan is quite worried. Chi-Chi tells Marron that her mommy is gonna win 10,000,000 zenny. Master Roshi gets excited, but Yamcha tells him they don't have time for laughing since they have no idea what's happening with Goku and the others. Meanwhile, Trunks and Goten throw off the remainder of their Mighty Mask outfit, mid-air over the ocean, as they notice Videl flying along. Goten calls out to her, and she notices him too. Back at the tournament grounds, Mr. Satan freaks out as Android 18 starts to come at him. She puts him in a [headlock, and he squirms and screams. She tells him to shut up, and then asks if he wants to win.
 No. 18 says she'll let him win, if he gives her 20,000,000 zenny. Mr. Satan is shocked at that amount, but she asks if he'd rather be knocked out. Mr. Satan says he'll pay, and then she jumps off of him as if she were knocked away. Mr. Satan starts giving a speech, telling her she has no chance, but she says to just hurry it up. So, Mr. Satan comes at her with a Dynamic Mess Em Up Punch. His fist hits her face, but she doesn't flinch at all, and asks if this is his sure-to-kill technique. He says yes, so she flies backwards and lands out of the ring. Mr. Satan is declared the winner, and the crowd goes wild. No. 18 walks away, saying she'll go to his house for the money tomorrow, and kill him if he doesn't pay.
 Videl has explained everything to Trunks and Goten, and they think an evil mage and a majin sounds awesome. Goten says everyone's over that way, and Trunks agrees that he feels his dad's and the others' ki there. Trunks says they'll have to hurry before they beat up the enemy, and Goten freaks out and says he wants to see first. The two of them turn Super Saiyan and zoom off, leaving Videl in their dust.

A Wicked Soul Revealed,455 (DBZ 261),"
 While Mr. Satan was been busy winning the World Martial Arts Tournament, Gohan has been facing off against Dabura… Gohan, as a Super Saiyan, punches ferociously at Dabura, but is blocked. He then kicks Dabura off into the distance, but Dabura catches himself, and blows a stream of fire back at Gohan. Gohan easily dodges it and flies back toward Dabura, but hits a few of Dabura's afterimages. The real Dabura is a distance away, and announces himself just before he shoots an electrified fireball toward Gohan. It's a direct hit and Gohan is knocked into the surrounding water. Gohan flies back up to the surface and throws away his tattered Great Saiyaman clothes which leaves only his tights.
 Goku says this guy's stronger than he thought. Vegeta thinks this is no one they can't beat, though, and thinks Gohan was stronger when he was just a brat. Goku agrees that he's really been slacking, but Vegeta is still getting irritated watching this. Gohan flies toward Dabura again, but Dabura spits at him. Gohan puts his hand up just in time to block it, so it hits his glove, and he quickly tosses the glove away as it turns to stone. Dabura then flies toward Gohan, and magically creates a giant sword. He swings the sword down at Gohan, but Gohan catches it, and snaps the blade in half. Babidi wonders what Dabura's doing, thinking he needs to inflict more damage.
 Vegeta is really pissed now, and says he's gonna end this himself. Goku tells him Gohan isn't really losing, but Vegeta says he doesn't care about this game. Vegeta wants to hurry up and end this so he can fight him, that's why he went to that stupid tournament in the first place. Dabura smirks, as Gohan wonders why he all of a sudden isn't fighting back. Dabura telepathically tells Babidi to return them to the ship, since he's discovered something great that will revive Majin Buu. Babidi goes along with it and they're suddenly back in the ship. Dabura heads back through the door, but Gohan asks him why he's running away from their fight. He tells Gohan he's not running away, he's just found another fighter. Babidi thinks this better be a great discovery. Dabura tells Babidi that one of them holds a strong evil heart that they could use on their side. Babidi likes the idea of them fighting each other to gather the necessary energy, and thinks Majin Buu will finally be revived.
"
Goku vs. Vegeta,456 (DBZ 262),"孫悟空対ベジータ 
 After informing his master Babidi that he has found the next warrior for the Majin clan, Dabura retreats from his battle with Gohan. Gohan, Goku, the Supreme Kai, and Vegeta ponder as to whom Dabura is referring to. Below their floor on Babidi's spaceship, Babidi looks into his Crystal Ball with excitement and gazes on Vegeta, who Dabura was talking about earlier. Dabura noticed Vegeta's frustration during his fight with Gohan and realized that Babidi could use Vegeta's rage and anger against him to become a slave for Babidi's cause. Babidi giggles at the thought of having such a powerful Saiyan become one of his own lackeys, and begins to use his dark magic to possess Vegeta's mind
 As Babidi begins the spell, Vegeta is suddenly overcome with a torturous headache, eating away at him with no mercy. As Supreme Kai pleads to Vegeta in woe to not give in to whatever Babidi is asking of him, Vegeta holds his head in agony as the spell becomes stronger. Supreme Kai continues to plead with Vegeta not to give into Babidi's powers, but Vegeta orders Supreme Kai to remain silent, as his constant warnings are not helping the headache. Babidi continues to gleefully torture Vegeta, with Goku and Gohan standing in shock over what abilities the wizard possesses. Despite the warnings of Supreme Kai, and the encouragement to fight back from Gohan, Vegeta transforms into a Super Saiyan, and emerges from the attack on his mind with an evil grin, and Babidi's signature ""M"" on his forehead, showing he has become one of Babidi's minions.
 Curious to see Vegeta's destructive capabilities for himself, Babidi transports his spaceship to the World Martial Arts Tournament arena, where most of Goku, Gohan, and Vegeta's friends and family are located. As the spectators in the crowd gasp at the sudden materialization of these people in the middle of the arena, Babidi orders Vegeta from his spaceship to steal the energy and murder everyone within the vicinity, including the spectators, the Saiyans, and the Supreme Kai. Vegeta barks back at Babidi's order, refusing to accept it, as his intentions lie with Goku, and the rematch Vegeta has desired for many years, to erase the embarrassment and restore his pride which he claimed to have lost when Goku and his friends stopped his plans many years ago. Babidi becomes surprised that his spell had not totally eclipsed Vegeta's mind, but allows for Vegeta to carry on. Master Roshi and Yamcha notice the commotion from the higher stands and wonder how this event occurred, to begin with, worrying for the safety of the civilians.
 Also located on the battle arena is Mr. Satan, the world champion. At first, believing them all to be possible contenders who have entered too late, he almost immediately recognizes Goku and Vegeta from the battle with Cell Games, seven years prior, becoming frantically worried that one of them is here to take Mr. Satan's place as world champion. Vegeta continues to bear his sinister smile, as he raises his right hand and prepares to power up a Big Bang Attack. Goku notices that Vegeta is aiming this attack right at the spectators in the crowd. As Goku screams at Vegeta, begging him not to slaughter anyone, Vegeta ignores Goku's pleas and fires the attack with lightning speed, striking the stands and the buildings behind them, blowing up a large chunk of the crowd, also killing everyone within the blast's radius, with Vegeta still retaining his grin. As Vegeta's friends cannot believe he has performed such a monstrosity, Goku looks in horror at both the debris and Vegeta himself, as Vegeta continues to grin sinfully. Bulma, who barely escaped Vegeta's blast, screams at Vegeta and pleads to him to tell her what is wrong and to stop immediately, however, Vegeta hears none of her cries. Showing his might, Vegeta orders for Goku to fight him immediately or he will murder more people without a second's hesitation. Goku questions Vegeta's state of mind, believing that his actions are not of Babidi's influence and that he is murdering people from his own free will. Vegeta continues to stare at Goku menacingly as he charges another attack and fires it at another section of the stands, murdering even more people within the blast's large radius, while not even glancing at the people he is slaughtering. In order to combat Vegeta, Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan, although Supreme Kai pleads to Goku not to combat Vegeta, as this will allow for Babidi to gather more energy to revive Majin Buu from his slumber. Goku confirms his suspicions by claiming that Vegeta's angst and hatred against Goku all of these years for constantly topping Vegeta in strength have influenced his decision to allow Babidi to grant him more powers to combat Goku for a rematch. Vegeta confirms these claims and informs Goku that he knows Goku only has 24 hours left on Earth before he has to return to the Other World, so this will be the only chance he gets.
 Supreme Kai claims Vegeta to be insane, with Vegeta replying in great disgust at Supreme Kai's insults, yelling at the Kai that fighting lives within a Saiyan's soul and blood, and ignoring urges to fight goes against everything Saiyan's stand for. Due to being the Prince of the Saiyans when his father ruled the planet, Vegeta begins to lose his composure and begins to violently scream and shout, claiming that his higher class position and his family's bloodline should mean that he should be the strongest Saiyan ever born, but his theories are constantly destroyed with Goku's rapid advancements in strength. Understanding Vegeta's intentions, Goku orders Babidi to transport them to a remote land where nobody shall be hurt in order for Vegeta and Goku to brawl without casualties. Supreme Kai demands that Goku stands down and stands within his path, informing Goku he will need to kill him if he wants to stop Vegeta. Gohan and Vegeta stand with admiration of Supreme Kai's dedication to stop Buu's resurrection. However, Goku ignores Supreme Kai's pleas and begins to threaten Supreme Kai by holding out his hand towards him, charging an energy attack aimed right at Supreme Kai. Gohan becomes greatly disturbed at Goku's actions, greatly wondering if Goku will go to these extreme measures to stop Vegeta. Vegeta meanwhile looks at the scene with surprise and slight admiration. After a while, Supreme Kai eventually stands down, knowing that if he dies, Buu will have more of a chance of being revived. Goku apologizes to the Supreme Kai for the extreme threat, and Babidi giggles at Supreme Kai's actions, deeming him a coward. Babidi teleports the Supreme Kai, Goku, Gohan, and Vegeta to the wilder-lands. Supreme Kai informs Goku that he and Gohan will take care of Dabura and Babidi while Vegeta and Goku can battle.
"
Vegeta's Pride,457 (DBZ 263),"After slaughtering many civilians at the World Martial Arts Tournament stadium, Vegeta stands confident and proud of his new ascension to power thanks to the dark magic of the wizard Babidi discovering Vegeta's inner evil. As hundreds of spectators flee the stadium in fear, Vegeta's wife Bulma, who barely escaped death, attempts to get Vegeta's attention from the stands, begging an answer as to why he has mercilessly killed so many people. Looking in awe, Goku demands an answer from Vegeta as well. Still smirking for his sinful actions, Vegeta looks towards Goku and, instead of answering Goku's plea, demands for Goku to fight him in a brawl or else more chaos and death shall ensue. Goku refuses without hesitation, and still demands for Vegeta to stand down. In retort, Vegeta charges up another large attack and, before Goku can respond, Vegeta fires the attack at another section of the stands, causing debris and flames to rise from the impact.
 Majin Vegeta As Goku observes the destruction and chaos around him, he finally gives into his anger, and transforms into a Super Saiyan to combat Vegeta. Supreme Kai intervenes and pleads for Goku to not give into Vegeta's violent demands, stating that Babidi is controlling Vegeta, so Goku will contribute energy towards Majin Buu's resurrection. Goku questions this however, as he believes Vegeta would not be able to be conquered mentally by Babidi. Understanding Vegeta's prideful personality, Goku makes the connection that Vegeta let Babidi control him on purpose simply to make Vegeta's inner powers unleash themselves. Vegeta confirms this, stating he knew he would not beat Goku in his original state and, knowing Goku only has twenty four hours on Earth, decided to give himself to Babidi in order to raise his powers so he could combat Goku and finally defeat him after many years of bitterness and jealousy. Supreme Kai accuses Vegeta of being completely insane, to which Vegeta angrily informs Supreme Kai that he never cared about the presence and possible awakening of Buu, and only cares for the regaining of his pride in a battle against his rival and enemy, stating that it is an attitude all Saiyans used to abide by. Still believing that he should be stronger due to his royal bloodline, Vegeta rages at how he has always being surpassed by Goku, a Saiyan who is completely against the moral codes most Saiyans stood by before they went extinct; the fact that Goku tries to lay mercy to all of his evil opponents he has defeated further confuses Vegeta.
"
Two Battles to the Death,458 (DBZ 264),"
 Babidi is shocked and tries again, but Vegeta still refuses as he only wants to fight Kakarrot. And as the pride-filled Saiyan prince, Vegeta tells Babidi even if he even if he control his body and mind, his pride alone is not as Babidi thought. Babidi thinks someone so full of pride is a first, but Dabura assures him that Vegeta's only purpose was to take energy. If Supreme Kai should make it to them, Dabura will kill him. Supreme Kai can't believe that Vegeta was able to defy Babidi like that. Goku hadn't realized Vegeta wanted to settle the score that much. Dabura suggests that Babidi open the door for Supreme Kai, so that they won’t risk Majin Buu being revived at less than full strength.
 They prepare to hop down the hole, but first, Goku gives Gohan one of the two remaining Senzu Beans, and tells him to eat it now. Goku also tells him to get angry like he had when fighting Cell, as it will bring out the depths of his power. If he does that, there's no one he can lose to. Gohan is sorry this all had to happen on his one-day here, as he and Supreme Kai hop down the hole. The floor panel to the next floor is open as well, and they continue down until they reach the bottom. They arrive in the room with Majin Buu's ball, where Babidi and Dabura are waiting. Supreme Kai and Babidi snidely greet each other, and he tells Gohan he'll fight Babidi.
 Goku powers up to Super Saiyan 2 Goku and Vegeta stare each other down. Goku says he doesn't want his damage to be received by Majin Buu as energy, so he's going to end this at his highest power. Vegeta is curious to see the fruits of his training in the Other World. Goku then powers up, with electricity flying all around his body, and Vegeta says he's even stronger than Gohan was ""back then"" before powering up himself. Goku thinks he needs to end this soon. Vegeta says he'll kill him, as he throws a hard kick that Goku barely blocks. Vegeta pulls back, and then throws a punch that Goku catches. Goku throws his own punch with his free hand, which Vegeta catches with his free hand. They attempt to knee each other, until Vegeta head butts Goku and knocks him away. Goku recovers, and then kicks Vegeta, sending him crashing into the ground. Vegeta comes back from the impact, and the two of them smirk at each other.
"
Countdown,459 (DBZ 265),"Babidi suggests they all return to the surface, as Majin Buu will soon be at full power and might destroy the ship when he emerges from his ball. Supreme Kai agrees, even though he won't allow that to happen. ""Paparapapa!!"" They are suddenly transported outside, along with Majin Buu's ball. Babidi asks Dabura if he can defeat that Earthling, and Dabura says there is no doubt. Gohan remembers his father's words and tries getting angry as he turns Super Saiyan. Babidi says he won't be done in like father, as he has greater magic power than Papa and Dabura's here this time. The meter on Majin Buu's ball begins beeping, and Babidi looks down to see that it’s already full. Babidi is extremely elated with excitement.
 Supreme Kai can't believe Goku has already taken so much damage. Gohan realizes it must be because his father and Vegeta are likely both fighting at the level well beyond Super Saiyan, and so the damage must be incredible. Meanwhile, Goku takes a punch to the face, and then Vegeta takes a punch to the face. The two of them clash, and a cloud of smoke builds up around them. Trunks and Goten wonder if those incredible ki belong to their fathers. Trunks wonders what's actually going on, since their locations keep changing.
 Goku and Vegeta break, and catch their breath. Goku says they're equals, and figures Vegeta has trained even more than he had. However, Vegeta tells Goku that the difference has never changed when he watch Goku fight Babidi's monster. That's when Vegeta secretly decided to fall under Babidi's control so difference with Goku would be gone. Goku asks if the pride-filled Vegeta would really let himself be controlled just because he wanted to get strong. Vegeta proclaims he wanted to return his former self but was influenced by everyone, had a family, and even grew to like Earth. That's why by letting Babidi control him, Vegeta would return to his original evil self and feels really now. Goku wonders if that's really true, as smoke starts to shoot up from Majin Buu's ball.
"
The Djinn Awakens?!,460 (DBZ 266),"Majin Buu's cocoon begins to erupt large amounts of smoke and steam. Dabura and Babidi smile in excitement for the re-emerging of Bibidi's original creation, the being supposedly stronger than anything ever existing. Gohan and Supreme Kai also watch in complete awe, but instead of excitement, they feel extreme worry for what is to come. As the cocoon begins to crack, Supreme Kai orders Gohan to run away, as they do not stand a chance when the legendary Majin Buu will finally emerge from his prison. Gohan, however, refuses to back down, not wanting to let his his father down, and not make the same mistakes he did when toying with Cell seven years ago. As Supreme Kai repeats his order, not caring for whatever reason Gohan states, Gohan still refuses, and in a loud yell, begins to charge up an Electric Kamehameha. As Dabura and Babidi wonder what Gohan plans to do, Gohan fires the Kamehameha at full power towards the cocoon. As Dabura grabs his master and jumps away from the blast, the beam hits the cocoon, but the cocoon does not move an inch. Babidi states any effort on attacking the cocoon is absolutely futile, however, Gohan keeps trying. Eventually, the cocoon flies high into the air and lands with a hard impact several feet away. As Babidi and Dabura look in confusion as to what might have happened, Supreme Kai gives a slight grin. As Majin Buu has not emerged from his prison, Supreme Kai thinks that due to being sealed up for millions of years, Majin Buu must have grown drastically weaker, and thus, Gohan's Kamehameha was enough to destroy the monster. As Babidi begins to growl, thinking that Supreme Kai is possibly right, Supreme Kai states Vegeta and Goku's battle will take quite a while due to them being almost equal, so Supreme Kai asks for Gohan to defeat Dabura while he takes on Babidi, and everything should return to normal. Gohan however, not feeling incredibly terrified, feels an incredible ki level which is far higher than anything he has ever felt before. As he looks up into the sky, he spots an incredibly large cloud, forming in the sky. As Supreme Kai notices this cloud also, Dabura and Babidi also glance at the giant cloud, as it begins to get smaller and smaller, forming into something else. Supreme Kai now also begins to feel terrified, beginning to believe that this cloud may be the dreaded Majin Buu forming after Gohan's attack. As Babidi looks on in extreme anticipation and Dabura looks with surprise, Supreme Kai and Gohan look in horror as the cloud morphs into a being, now forming what looks like a gloved hand. As Gohan gasps, the being is finally complete. An overweight pink creature, wearing a purple cape, white underwear, yellow boots with yellow gloves, having small black holes on its arms and head, also having a small antenna and two large rounded ears, similar to Cell and Frieza's. Majin Buu has now emerged and begins to cheer, now being finally free after millions of years of hibernation. As Buu dances, Gohan and Supreme Kai, still motionless while watching the odd creature, are now too late from stopping Majin Buu's arrival.
"
Can This Be Boo?!,461 (DBZ 267),"Majin Buu, the being Supreme Kai is so afraid of and has tried to stop getting awakened from his cocoon, is now free, dancing in joy. Babidi and his right-hand man Dabura however, are unsure if the being who has emerged from the cocoon is actually the deadly Buu they assumed he would be, due to Buu's quite overweight and childlike appearance. Gohan is also unsure if this creature is as impossible to destroy as Supreme Kai built him up to be. As Buu finally descends back to the ground, he stands still in silence for a few seconds. Suddenly, he begins to chuckle, and hunch over, making strange noises. Gohan confirms with Supreme Kai if this being is actually Buu, as Gohan can still not believe this thing is as menacing as he was told. Supreme Kai confirms him with certainty, still trembling and sweating in fear just looking at Buu. Gohan starts to notice Buu's incredible high ki level, but still believes he can destroy Buu if he focuses all his energy into one devastating attack. Meanwhile, Goku and Majin Vegeta, still in their brutal showdown, stop the fight as Goku notices Majin Buu's ridiculous power level, as begins to worries, stating Gohan and Supreme Kai will need help in order to even stand a chance. Vegeta, however, states if Buu has nothing to do with their fight, he will not interrupt the opportunity he has been waiting so long to accomplish: to defeat and destroy Goku, and that Majin Buu is not as strong as they are, so he will be a piece of cake.
 Meanwhile, Babidi finally tries to talk with Buu, who is still wandering aimlessly like a small toddler. Babidi tries to explain to Buu that his father Bibidi created him, and thus, his son Babidi, now has control. However, Buu continues to wander around and ignore Babidi's sentence. As Babidi begins to get more frustrated as Buu continues to ignore him, Buu childishly sticks out his large tongue, and makes more silly noises, giving Babidi a startling fright. Dabura, now tired of Majin Buu's behavior, insults him by calling him a fat, stupid loser. Buu hears this harsh remark and pretending not to notice, hops nearer Dabura while humming a song. Dabura now adds to his previous insult, not only calling Buu a loser but an arrogant loser. Gohan, now having seen Buu's behavior for a few minutes, labels Babidi's mission a failure, as Buu seems pretty harmless. However, Supreme Kai states that Gohan will be eating those words in a few minutes, with no chance of escape anymore. Buu, now losing the charade of pretending not to listen, now erupts more steam from his head, and in a sudden movement, pokes and gouges Dabura's eyes, making Dabura scream in absolute agony as his eyes begin to bleed quickly. Buu follows his unmerciful attack by kicking Dabura directly into a nearby rocky mountain, knocking the ""Demon King"" out in only two hits. As Gohan looks in absolute terror (as he himself struggled to even attempt to defeat Dabura), Babidi shows his complete satisfaction with Buu, completely amazed how he managed to defeat his best henchman so quickly. As Dabura lays unconscious and bleeding, Gohan and Supreme Kai stand their ground and prepare themselves for what Buu may do next.
"
The Menace of Boo,462 (DBZ 268),"Majin Buu has proven his might as a powerful opponent and servant to Babidi by smashing Dabura into the rocky mountains with effortless triumph. Babidi praises Buu for his spectacular showcase of strength, as Gohan and Supreme Kai look at Buu in total despair, terrified of the monster's power and unpredictable behavior patterns. Buu begins to make unintelligible noises, similar to noises of an ape, to celebrate his love of random violence. Meanwhile, near the World Tournament stadium, Trunks and Goten notice a strong ki suddenly arise from seemingly nowhere. Trunks guesses that the only being to appear out of nowhere like they sensed would be a genie, which rises both boy's curiosities. Trunks and Goten power themselves up and head for the location of the sudden power rise, hoping to meet this genie.
 Vegeta takes the last Senzu Bean and says he will stop Buu himself Meanwhile, Vegeta powered up by Babidi's magic and Goku continue to brawl to avoid Vegeta causing extreme violence to innocents. As the fight continues, Goku also notices the sudden rise of energy near Babidi's spaceship, and he presumes that Buu has been released and that Gohan and Supreme Kai have failed. Goku pleads with Vegeta to end the fight to inspect the change in events, as the situation may need handling immediately. Vegeta refuses Goku's request, as he does not wish to waste time investigating while Goku's time on Earth is limited, and wishes to spend it fighting him to put to rest who is the greatest warrior between them. Goku begs for Vegeta to put aside personal quarrels he may have with destroying him. He reminds Vegeta that if Supreme Kai's statements are held accurate, Buu would be near unstoppable and will cause the extinction of the whole planet, including Bulma and Trunks. Vegeta orders Goku with unlimited fury to remain quiet, and explains that any compassion and love he developed for his wife and son have disappeared now that his power was returned to him by Babidi's magic. Goku refuses to believe this statement and tells Vegeta that he has changed, and so have his morals and priorities, including his new focus for the well-being of his family over unlimited power and control like before. Vegeta growls but does not deny these claims. Vegeta eventually gives in but tells Goku that once Buu has been dealt with, the fight will resume with a victor. Goku agrees to these terms, and Vegeta orders him to toss him a Senzu Bean as they have used up much of their energy in their struggle. Goku gladly complies and gives Vegeta a Senzu Bean. As Goku attempts to grab another bean for himself from his bag, Vegeta has realized that he let Buu out of his shell and decides to make the right decision as he hits Goku in the back of the head with a Double Axe Handle, knocking Goku out. As Goku becomes unconscious, Vegeta informs Goku he wishes to handle Buu alone, as Buu was released in the first place because of Vegeta's actions. Vegeta bids farewell to Goku and wishes to return the fight if he succeeds. With some uncertainty of his fate, Vegeta flies off to handle Buu, while Goku remains helpless.
 Back near the spaceship, Buu stands silently while Babidi starts to inform him he is not a freelancer and that he is to serve under Babidi's command for all time. Buu does not bother to pay attention to these demands, however, and simply sticks his tongue out at Babidi in a playful manner. Disgusted by Buu's response, Babidi orders Buu to truly think what his best options are. Babidi informs Buu his father left notes on how to handle Buu if he was to become uncontrollable, and instructions on how to seal Buu back into a Sealed Ball. Buu pays attention after hearing the possibility of being sealed up again for all eternity, and bows to Babidi in worry. Babidi accepts this apology, and orders Buu to finish off Gohan and Supreme Kai. Supreme Kai states to Gohan that escape is futile, as Gohan looks in woe. Gohan brings the idea to the table that due to Buu's childlike attitude, if Babidi and his strict and harsh routine were dealt with, Buu might be more reasonable and accept responsibility and live a peaceful life. Supreme Kai questions Gohan's motives and reminds him that Babidi is the only one who can seal Buu away back into his tomb. Supreme Kai informs Gohan the only solution now may be to hope over time, Babidi will become tired of Buu and seal him away again. Frustrated with himself, Supreme Kai blames himself for this mistake and states if he knew Earthlings and Saiyans were as strong as they were, he would have used his alternative solution. Gohan becomes extremely curious, but before Supreme Kai can answer, Gohan notices Babidi ordering Buu to destroy them. Gohan grabs Supreme Kai's hand in desperation and hopes he can outrun Buu until they can reach a safe spot. Noticing them retreat, Buu takes a running stance and sprints after them at the speed of light. In a few seconds, Buu appears right in front of Gohan, mocking him. As Gohan stares in shock at Buu's potential, Buu swats Gohan out of the air and Gohan smashes into rocks with blunt force. Supreme Kai looks in shock as Buu begins to menacingly approach him. Supreme Kai uses a Kiai to halt and damage Buu's attacks, but the attack merely makes Buu's head turn, as Buu grins excitedly as he smacks Supreme Kai with brutal force, before pummeling him into the ground. As Gohan moves from the rubble, he notices Supreme Kai falling to the ground, but becoming helpless to assist him. Babidi bounces with joy at Buu's stunning skill and praises him for his powers. As the battle looks bleak for Supreme Kai, Gohan continues to look in awe at the creature able to handle him in one fell swoop.
"
Terrifying Power,463 (DBZ 269),"
 After being thumped to the ground by Majin Buu's ridiculous power, Supreme Kai emerges from the rubble bruised and bloodied. Buu notices his victim is still alive, and he cheers at the second chance of pounding the Supreme Kai. Buu bounces back to the ground and giggles, letting out a large grin of pleasure. From afar, Babidi barks more orders at Buu, demanding Buu to finish his opponents. Buu takes note, and he prepares to eliminate the Supreme Kai while whistling a tune. Supreme Kai lifts himself in agony and uses an Invisible Eye Blast to hit Buu directly in the face. The only effect of the attack is Buu's head slightly moving backward, as the attack leaves Buu with no fatigue or signs of injury. Buu mockingly uses his own version of Supreme Kai's attack to blast him many feet away, with Buu flying after him, still gleeful. As Supreme Kai comes to a halt, Buu performs somersaults in the air and drops himself onto Supreme Kai's back, making the Supreme Kai scream out in pain. Babidi rushes to their location and proceeds to mock Supreme Kai for the position he is in, making fun of the Supreme Kai's unfortunate position he is in. Babidi decides to end things, and orders Buu to execute the Supreme Kai to serve justice. Just before Buu or Babidi can deal the final blow, Gohan manages to kick Buu in the cheek with all of his remaining force. As Buu flies, he recovers himself and proceeds to heal the dent in his face. Babidi growls in frustration at the delay of Supreme Kai's death. Gohan looks onto Buu in fear, noticing the attack did not leave any marks, and his ki has not decreased. Buu begins to be bored of Gohan and exclaims he will now die. Gohan becomes stunned for a brief second, but turns to anger immediately after, preparing to punch Buu. Buu extends his hands and unleashes a large sphere of energy, catching Gohan off guard. The attack hits Gohan and launches him into the sky, before eventually flying off too far to be visible to a naked eye. Babidi exclaims he cannot see Gohan anymore and hopes Gohan flies off the face of the planet. Noticing Gohan flying off into the distance, Supreme Kai uses the last of his energy to make Buu's attack explode in mid-air, stopping Gohan from going any further. Gohan manages to land in a forest but is unconscious and near death. Thinking Gohan is dead, Babidi tells Buu to finally finish off the Supreme Kai and end the conflict once and for all. Buu prepares to hit Supreme Kai with a finishing move, but from the rubble, Dabura returns, bleeding and broken, and throws his spear through Buu's gut. Babidi gasps in surprise, truly believing Dabura to be dead after Buu struck him. Dabura breaths in pain, while Babidi growls at Dabura for daring to attack his father's creation.
 Off in the distance, Goten and Trunks have now reached the location of the large ki, and have been watching the battle, confused and amazed. Trunks and Goten notice Supreme Kai, who they had seen at the World Martial Arts Tournament a few hours earlier, and they wonder what the situation unfolding in front of them is about. Before they can get an answer, Trunks notices something odd in the distance. Trunks and Goten rush to check it out, and they notice Piccolo, still a stone statue due to Dabura's Stone Spit, along with a statue Krillin. Both wonder what these statues are doing in the wastelands, and Trunks tries to touch the Piccolo statue but forgets to conceal his strength, and with the force of his hand, knocks over the statue, breaking it into many small pieces. Trunks desperately panics and in absolute dire, attempts to fix the statue to no avail. Before he can do any more, Goten tells Trunks to hide quickly, as the people below them may notice them messing around. Goten and Trunks duck behind large rocks and watch the situation continue to unfold.
 Dabura informs Babidi that although his creation is indeed a marvel of strength and the ultimate creation in history, is it not to be taken lightly and it will eventually betray Babidi despite how it is treated. Babidi ignores Dabura's warnings and scolds him for daring to attack Buu, to begin with. Buu grabs the front end of the spear with no concern and simply pulls it out of his stomach like it was nothing. Dabura looks in horror at Buu's healing abilities and near immortality, while Buu heals the hole in his stomach and turns to Dabura with an unfriendly smile, exclaiming that Dabura shall be eaten. As Dabura watches Buu make his threats, Goten and Trunks still watch in awe, and Babidi continues to grin at all of Buu's surprises.
"
Vegeta vs. Boo,464 (DBZ 270),"Vegeta approaches Babidi's spaceship, with the unconscious Goku still lying on the wasteland ground. Vegeta hopes that destroying the ship might weaken Majin Buu's power in some way, or at least hinder his activities on Earth only. As Vegeta looks downwards into the ship's dark and empty inner shell, he contemplates his recent choices and begins to regret his hateful and selfish decisions. As he notices Gohan's ki has disappeared, he apologizes for his wrongdoings, proceeds to destroy the ship and help put an end to Babidi's sadistic schemes.
 Back on the battlefield, Buu begins to taunt the broken and bloodied Dabura, who had just thrown a spear through Buu's belly. Buu continuously mocks Dabura and states he will be a tasty snack. Sick of these claims, Dabura furiously attempts to punch Buu, calling Buu a monster. However, before Dabura can even make the move, Buu jerks his head forwards and raises his antenna. As Buu begins to scream ""COOKIE!"", a pink beam zaps from his antenna and strikes Dabura. The beam encompasses Dabura and lifts him into the air. As Dabura screams for help, his body begins to morph into a new substance. In a split second, Dabura has transformed into a cookie, with the cookie retaining Dabura's likeness. As Buu grabs his snack, he extends his mouth to fit in the cookie whole and shoves the snack into his mouth. As Buu begins to munch on his new food, Goten and Trunks, watching from afar, look on in complete awe and shock at Buu's abilities and actions.
 In a sudden flash, Krillin (a second ago a statue) has now transformed back into his normal self, as Supreme Kai stated earlier that the only way to return to human form after Dabura turns you into a statue is for Dabura to die. Trunks manages to figure this out, and realizing Piccolo was here too, rushes to check up on him. Having previously smashed his statue before, Trunks worries if Piccolo, despite being turned back, will still be in many pieces. Trunks finds Piccolo's broken body, and begins to panic, with Krillin acting accordingly. As Trunks begins to attempt bribery on Krillin and Goten to make sure nobody knows it was his fault, they hear a voice above them. It is Piccolo, standing with his cape blowing in the wind. Before he can explain himself, Piccolo informs everyone to stay low and keep their power levels low, or they will be detected and destroyed. Trunks begins how Piccolo is still alive after being smashed into pieces, with Piccolo answering that his regeneration ability is not a hard task and it can heal any limbs as long as his head is intact. Piccolo and Krillin begin to sense Majin Buu's gigantic power level, far beyond anything they have ever encountered before, far surpassing even Cell.
 Piccolo also takes notice of the Supreme Kai lying on the ground, broken and defeated, next to Buu and Babidi. Despite knowing his odds of success are naught, Piccolo attempts to get up and save the Supreme Kai from Buu's might. Krillin orders for Piccolo to consider the odds and accept that Supreme Kai cannot be saved. Goten also informs Piccolo of Buu's ability to morph his opponents into food, making Piccolo growl in frustration. As the Supreme Kai groans in agony near death, Buu considers what food he would prefer to eat now, considering both chocolate and jello. As Buu prepares to eat the Lord of Lords, a sudden flash of white light bursts from behind them, followed by a huge explosion. Babidi begins to scream at the loss of his spaceship, a figure emerges from the smoke. Vegeta slowly descends to the ground with a smirk on his face, looking towards Babidi. As Babidi scolds Vegeta for his actions, Vegeta turns to Buu, who now looks confused and curious. Vegeta begins to question Buu, calling him a repugnant blob and ordering him to answer if he was the one who killed Gohan. Hearing this, Piccolo gasps in shock over this news and begins to boil in anger as Trunks asks Piccolo what did Vegeta say, but Piccolo remains in horror of Gohan's death. Not understanding what ""repugnant"" means, Buu asks his master what the meaning of the word is. Babidi explains to Buu that the word basically means Buu is ugly and frightens people. Hearing this, Buu turns his view to Vegeta and his anger begins to boil inside his head, letting it out in bursts of steam from the holes in his head. Chanting he will murder Vegeta, Babidi congratulates Buu's violent temper and orders him to teach Vegeta a lesson for betraying his cause. As Buu's ki increases even higher, Vegeta raises his own. Raising his voice, Vegeta claims that if he has to go to Hell for fighting this battle, he will be bringing Buu and Babidi with him. Supreme Kai realizes Vegeta is not going to win this battle easily, without some sacrifice. As the battle is ready to begin, Vegeta and Buu take their fighting positions, to decide the fate of the other Z Fighters and the planet.
"
Boo Gets Mad,465 (DBZ 271),"Vegeta begins his brutal assault on Majin Buu, the creation of Babidi's father, the wizard Bibidi. Starting with the full force of his fists, Vegeta begins to swiftly and quickly attack Buu with all his might at lightning speeds, not letting Buu take a break from the barrage of punches and kicks. Vegeta continues his attack without mercy or hesitation, as Babidi looks upon the battle in confusion over Buu's sudden submission to Vegeta, wondering if Buu has a surprise on his hands or if Vegeta truly is stronger than his servant of destruction. From a distance, Krillin, Piccolo, Goten, and Trunks watch the two clash, with Krillin admiring Vegeta's stamina and force. As Trunks cheers for his father, Piccolo measures Vegeta's newfound powers and determines that Vegeta has now surpassed Cell and even Gohan when he fought Cell as a Super Saiyan 2. However, even with this knowledge, Piccolo does not change his opinion over who the victor will be, as from previous conversations heard overhead, Piccolo believes both Gohan and Shin to be dead, so Vegeta will not stand much higher of a chance. Majin Buu finally manages to escape Vegeta's barrage, and lets himself heal the dents in his body in one split second. Vegeta extends his right hand and two fingers, and prepares a new energy attack. As Majin Buu begins to wonder what this sudden gesture means, a beam of small light fires from Vegeta's fingers and pierces Buu through the stomach at light speed, making a large hole in his belly and making Buu fly backward. As Buu begins to tumble, he lays still on the floor and smoke rises from his gaping wound.
 Vegeta believes this to be a success, and looks towards his son in with a smile in pride, as Trunks cheers for this father once more. However, noticing from afar, Buu begins to raise himself up, still with his gigantic wound. As Buu stands upright, he extends his stomach and heals the wound with a quick pop. As Vegeta looks on in frustration and confusion, Buu informs Vegeta that his attack hurt him for the first time, even if it was just a little. As Buu's temper begins to boil, he covers his chest and a pink circle of energy emits from his body. Cheering for his servant, Babidi orders Buu to finish Vegeta quickly without much more delay. However, Buu ignores his master's command and continues to build up his large circular wave. The grounds begin to shake and tumble under Buu's gargantuan power. As Vegeta and his friends look on in woe, Buu lets out a high scream, saying he will hurt Vegeta. Buu lets off the wave as an enormous explosion, engulfing the wastelands around him. Piccolo orders everyone nearby him to try and outrun the attack, while Babidi panics and creates for himself a Magic Barrier, as he would not be able to escape the blast. As the attack continues, entire rock formations collapse under the intense power and pressure and everyone on the battlefield is knocked back by Buu's might. The attack then begins to die, and after all the smoke clears the battlefield, there is a gigantic crater covering much of the wasteland. Buu hovers in the middle of the crater, Babidi besides him cleans his sweat and orders Buu not to perform a procedure like that again unless absolutely required. Piccolo tends to his friends, who all survived the blast, and he begins to worry about the Supreme Kai who he believes was caught in the blast. Trunks begins to worry about his father, and shouts for his father to answer him. Vegeta did manage to survive the blast, but with a broken left arm with blood pouring from his wounds. As Vegeta stands himself up, he looks towards Buu with a fearful laugh, wondering if there is anything else which might put an end to the violent monster, with very little time to think of any options.
"
The Mastermind's Demise,466 (DBZ 272),"
 Vegeta curses the situation, with his left arm now out of commission. Babidi notices Vegeta is still alive, and thinks he might have made a really great servant were he not so disobedient. Piccolo thinks that Vegeta can't compete with Buu at all, Gohan is dead, and even Supreme Kai is gone. Trunks can't believe his father would lose, but Piccolo won't reassure him. Buu tells Vegeta, it's over for him. Vegeta wonders what to do, as Buu rips out a chunk of his stomach, and stretches it out like dough. Vegeta asks what this disgusting bastard is up to. Buu shoots an explosive blast from his mouth that Vegeta just barely dodges, and then throws the piece of his stomach out so that it snakes around Vegeta, tying him up.
 Buu does a happy dance, as Vegeta lies wrapped up on the ground. Buu kicks him across the ground, and then giggles as Vegeta coughs up blood. Buu then sits on Vegeta and starts pounding on him. Krillin says he's getting killed, and wonders where Goku or Gohan are, did they already die? Goten says his brother couldn’t die. Trunks is getting really restless, but Piccolo says there's nothing he could do if he went besides die, which would just add to Vegeta's pain. Trunks ignores that, turns Super Saiyan, and flies off. Goten does the same, and Piccolo gets mad at their hastiness. The boys zoom right past Babidi, leaving him confused. Trunks kicks Buu off of Vegeta, knocking him off into the distance, as Goten begins unravelling Vegeta.
 The boys tend to Vegeta, and Babidi can't believe Vegeta still has allies around. Babidi thinks it doesn't matter how many of them there are, because Majin Buu is invincible, and he'll kill them all. Babidi turns around, and Piccolo is there, who is preparing to kill Babidi after telling him he can't forgive him or Buu. Babidi says if he's killed, no one can ever seal Majin Buu away, and then the entire world will be completely destroyed. Piccolo says the world would get destroyed even if Babidi didn't die, and so Babidi starts to call Buu over to help. Piccolo then swipes his arm, and cuts Babidi in half with one clean chop. Babidi keeps talking as his remains fall back to the ground, and Piccolo spits down at him. Vegeta tells Trunks to take good care of his mother. Trunks is confused, and Vegeta smiles.
"
"Farewell, Proud Warrior",467 (DBZ 273),"The cover features Vegeta in his Saiyan battle armor giving a smile to the readers.
 Vegeta decides to use a suicidal technique in an attempt to finish Majin Buu Vegeta tells the boys to take refuge somewhere, he's going to fight Majin Buu alone. Trunks insists it would be better to fight together, but Vegeta says Buu can't be fought using normal methods. Trunks and Goten say they're both really strong. Vegeta tells Trunks that he's never hugged him since he was a baby, and wants to now. Trunks is reluctant, but Vegeta hugs him anyway. Vegeta smiles, and tells Trunks to be well. Then he pops Trunks on the back of the neck, knocking him out. Goten freaks out, but then Vegeta punches him in the gut, to knock him out as well. Piccolo flies over to them, as Buu gets up and starts humming, wondering who it was that hit him.
 Vegeta asks Piccolo to take the boys somewhere far away. Piccolo picks them up, and then realizes that Vegeta plans to die. Vegeta says nothing, and then asks Piccolo will he be able to see Kakarrot once he's dead. Piccolo tells him if he dies, his physical body will be gone due to killing too many innocent people. His soul will also be sent to a different world than Goku where it will be cleaned with his memories gone and he'll be turned into a new life form. Vegeta thinks that's too bad, and tells Piccolo to hurry and go. Piccolo flies off with the boys and Buu prepares to stop him, but Vegeta halts Buu. He says he's going to defeat Buu himself, calling him a balloon bastard.
 Piccolo flies past Krillin, and tells him to come along quickly. Vegeta says he finally knows how to defeat Buu. Buu is surprised, as Vegeta begins powering up. Krillin asks Piccolo what Vegeta is up to, so Piccolo explains that Vegeta has resolved to fight for someone other than himself for the first time, throwing away his own life in the process. Vegeta continues charging up, and he says he's going to blow Boo up into so many pieces that he won't be able to fix himself again. He smiles and thinks, ""Farewell… Bulma… Trunks… and even… Kakarrot…"" Vegeta then self-destructs, creating a huge explosion bigger than the one Buu had made earlier. Piccolo and Krillin, having flown quite a ways, feel the shockwave of the explosion.
"
Back to the Nightmare,468 (DBZ 274),"
 In the capsule plane, Bulma is wondering why Vegeta did what he did. Yamcha tells her not to think like that, for now they’ll just use the Dragon Balls to revive all of the dead spectators. Master Roshi thinks Vegeta seemed odd, with lots of evil flowing within him. The plane suddenly hits a lot of turbulence. Master Roshi says there was a great explosion far away, and Bulma feels like it could be related to Vegeta. Back at the battlefield, an in-tact ash figure of Vegeta is all that remains floating above a very large crater. The ash remains of Vegeta then fall to the earth and break apart. Meanwhile, Piccolo tells Krillin to take the boys home while he checks on things. He tells him they'll inform their families later, as he doesn't know about Goku, but Vegeta said Gohan was killed by Majin Buu. Krillin can't believe even Gohan is gone.
 Piccolo flies over and lands in the crater, walking around for a bit. He realizes what Vegeta's plan was, to keep Buu from regenerating. Then Piccolo notices Babidi's head, still just barely alive. It looks like Babidi had a barrier up during the explosion, so Piccolo decides to finish him off for good. But then, tiny pieces of Buu begin moving, each turning into a miniature Buu, and they all fly together to form one big mass. Realizing what's going on, Piccolo takes this opportunity to fly away. Majin Buu is now whole again, and he starts giggling, until Babidi calls him over. Babidi tells him to heal him, but Buu is hesitant. Babidi asks if he wants to be sealed up, and so Boo heals him. Babidi is glad, until he gets angry at the ones who did this to him. The green guy and the two little runts. Instead of destroying this planet, he wants to make those three suffer.
 Krillin can’t believe Majin Buu isn't dead, and that Vegeta died for nothing. Piccolo says it's dangerous on the Earth, and takes the boys from Krillin so he can bring them to The Lookout. These two are their only star of hope, albeit a faint hope. Buu is now flying through the air, and Babidi is riding on his back, saying they'll turn this planet into a living Hell. Babidi's plan is kill lots of people until those three show themselves. Elsewhere, Supreme Kai is alive, weakly walking around, and begging Gohan to still be alive…
"
A Slim Hope,469 (DBZ 275),"
 Goku finally wakes up, and sees that Vegeta took the last Senzu Bean. He realizes he was knocked out so Vegeta could fight Majin Buu alone. He feels Buu's ki, but not Vegeta's or Gohan's, and wonders what happened. However, he does feel Piccolo and Krillin's ki, meaning they’re no longer stone as Dabura has been killed, and they probably know what's going on. Goku then teleports away. Up on Kami's Lookout, Piccolo says it will probably be about an hour before the boys wake up. Krillin feels bad that Vegeta and Gohan are dead, and who knows what happened to Goku. Then he asks Dende if it would be okay to bring his family up here, knowing it's probably wrong to want to save just his friends. Dende asks Piccolo, but Piccolo says that he should decide for himself. Dende doesn't mind, since the Earth is still around because of them.
 Krillin prepares to leave, but he and Piccolo feel a familiar ki suddenly appear. Krillin is excited that Goku's alive (although technically he's not). Goku wants to know what happened, but Dende says he will heal him first. Some time passes, and Goku can't believe that Gohan, Shin and even Vegeta have been killed by Majin Buu. Piccolo says that Shin was right to fear Buu, and now the whole universe is in danger. Krillin thinks that the fact that Goku is alive is their happiness amidst the sorrow. He says Goku is the only one who can defeat Buu, and asks if he still has more time remaining in the mortal world.
 ""To put it bluntly, it’s impossible. I can’t defeat him. The difference in true strength between me and Vegeta was almost nil. Vegeta even gave up his life, but Majin Buu was barely affected, right? Sorry, but there's no way I could win."" Goku says he could've done something if Gohan and Vegeta were alive, though Piccolo says the amount of people there are doesn't make much difference against Buu. Goku didn't mean that, he wanted to use Fusion. Dende's heard of this as well, it's the special technique of the Metamorans. Goku says he learned it from a Metamoran in the Other World. It's a union technique that only two people of similar power and body size can use. Two people fuse into one, and they can become an incredibly powerful person. Metamorans are weak on their own, but with Fusion, they become halfway-decent warriors.
 Piccolo realizes Goku could have fused with Gohan or Vegeta if they were alive. Goku says he was taught the technique, but he's never actually done it, since there was no one like him there. But even so, it took him a week to learn the technique. Piccolo thinks it's futile either way, but Krillin thinks Goku can go back to the Other World and fuse with Gohan or Vegeta. Piccolo bursts his bubble though by saying that even if Goku fused with either one, he can't return to the living world. Besides, Vegeta was sent to Hell due to all the evil deeds he committed throughout his life. Mr. Popo then suggests that the two sleeping inside, Goten and Trunks, have near-equal power and size. Goku thinks that's great, and says he'll teach them Fusion until he has to leave, and then Piccolo can train them afterwards. Piccolo agrees, and Krillin gets excited at this faint glimmer of hope.
 Piccolo thinks that it will take a long time for the boys to master Fusion, and many lives will be lost to Majin Buu in the meantime. Perhaps everyone will be annihilated, or even the Earth itself will be destroyed. Goku says as long as they're alive and they have the Dragon Balls, they can fix things. Krillin prepares to leave to fetch everyone, when the sky suddenly turns black. Krillin figures it must be Bulma who has summoned Shenron, and wonders why she'd gather the Dragon Balls without knowing the circumstances yet. Goku realizes they must be trying to bring everyone who had died since the beginning of the World Martial Arts Tournament back to life. Dende says it'll be a year before they can use the Dragon Balls again if they make three wishes, and so Goku focuses on their ki and teleports away.
 Outside of Capsule Corporation, everyone else has gathered, as Shenron asks them to state their wish. Yamcha tells Shenron to bring back the people who died except for the evil ones. Shenron grants the wish, and asks if they have another wish. Goku arrives, only to find that he's too late, while everyone else is shocked to see him. He telepathically contacts Dende, explaining that one wish has already been used up. Dende says if they only used one wish, then it will only be a four-month wait. Goku understands, and tells Dende to tell Krillin that he'll bring everyone there, since they're all gathered with him now. Goku then tells Shenron they've made enough wishes, and so Shenron bids them farewell. Yamcha asks Goku what's going on. Meanwhile, Babidi is still flying on Buu's back, and he wonders why it suddenly got dark and then bright again. Elsewhere, Kibito is alive again, and can't believe it.
"
Bobbidi's Revenge,470 (DBZ 276),"
 Babidi says he's going to cause quite a spectacle. Back at the remains of the battlefield, Kibito tries to figure out what’s going on, until he feels that Supreme Kai is still alive, and flies off. Supreme Kai is struggling along, saying that Gohan is still alive, until he collapses. Kibito reaches him shortly afterwards, and is just in time to heal him. Neither of them understand how Kibito is alive again, but then Supreme Kai freaks out and says they have to hurry to Gohan. Gohan is still lying on the ground in that forest, as the two of them fly off. Supreme Kai asks him if he feels that great ""power energy"" of Majin Buu, and Kibito does. Kibito thinks how hopeless things are now, and that all the life in the universe is in danger.
 Supreme Kai says it's not hopeless, as he sees a faint light. Kibito asks if it has something to do with Gohan. Supreme Kai says it does, because he thinks Gohan's far-beyond-imagination power could be changed into an even more unbelievable power, and he could surpass Majin Buu. Kibito wonders if he means ""that"", and Supreme Kai says he didn't see how strong those three Saiyans were. Then, they finally reach Gohan. Supreme Kai says they should bring him to Sacred World of the Kai before healing him, and Kibito can't believe he'd allow a human to set foot in the Sacred World of the Kai, that sacred ground that not even Grand Kai has set foot upon. Supreme Kai says yes, and they must hurry before Gohan dies. Kibito then teleports them away in a flash of light.
 Up at The Lookout, everyone is there now. Someone asks about Bulma's parents, but they stayed behind to look after the animals. But, they can still be returned to life by the Dragon Balls. Krillin says they don't know where Tien Shinhan and Chiaotzu are, either. Chi-Chi then asks about Gohan and Goten, and Bulma asks about Trunks and Vegeta. Goku decides it's best to tell them. Goten and Trunks are safe, Gohan and Vegeta are dead, killed by Majin Buu. Chi-Chi faints after hearing that she has lost her first son, and Ox-King catches her, while Videl becomes heartbroken about her boyfriend's death and Bulma begins crying about her husband's death. Then suddenly, Babidi communicates with the Earth's population and demands Piccolo, Trunks, and Goten. He then introduces himself and Majin Buu before having Buu show the people his strength. Buu lifts all of the people into the air, and then decides to turn them all into candy balls. He then sucks in all the candy balls like a vacuum, chews them up, and eats them.
"
A Time of Trial,471 (DBZ 277),"
 Now Babidi wants Buu to make the city look “neat”, but not too much, so he doesn't blow up the Earth. Buu takes a deep breath, and then exhales all over the city, completely blowing it up. Babidi shows everyone an image of Piccolo, Trunks, and Goten again, and anyone who knows where they are had better speak up, if they don't want to be turned into candy and eaten. And they'd better hurry, because everyone on Earth will be destroyed within five days. To contact Babidi, just call him out by thinking of him in your head. Someone suddenly contacts Babidi, a Budōkai attendant, to say that those three were participants today. Their names are Ma Junior, Trunks, and Son Goten. Babidi doesn't care about names, he wants addresses, but the attendant doesn’t have those. So, Babidi kills the guy by making his head explode.
 Babidi warns people not to waste his time like that, and tells everyone that they could be next. He tells everyone they have five days, again, and then ends the transmission. Piccolo is livid at this turn of events, and wants to go to prevent the loss of lives. Goku says not to talk stupid, he needs Piccolo to teach the boys Fusion when he's gone. That's the only way to defeat Buu, and they'll destroy the Earth either way. They can restore the people and the planet with the Dragon Balls. Piccolo agrees, and calms down. Far away from Earth in the Sacred World of the Kai, Supreme Kai tells Kibito to heal Gohan. Gohan wakes up, and wonders where they are. When he hears Sacred World of the Kai, Gohan figures he's dead, but realizes that he doesn't have a halo like his father and Supreme Kai tells Gohan that it was a close call and that he was saved.
 Kibito says originally, no mortals, or even gods or Kais, could come to this sacred land. Gohan remembers that Kibito should be dead, and asks if he revived himself. Kibito says no, but he doesn't know how he came back to life. Gohan asks why he's here, and Kibito would like to know as well. Supreme Kai tells Gohan he wants him to use the Z Sword to defeat Majin Buu. Kibito freaks out, and says there's no way a mortal could ever use that legendary blade that no one, even Supreme Kai, have been able to use. Supreme Kai tells Kibito he doesn't know how unbelievably incredible Gohan's power really is since he was dead. He wants to go try now, so the three of them fly off toward its location.
 As they fly along, Kibito says Gohan's tattered clothes are too inappropriate for this sacred land, and so he magically gives Gohan an outfit just like his own. Supreme Kai thinks it looks good on him, but Gohan feels weird looking just like Kibito. The three of them land atop a very tall, thin pillar-like plateau, where the Z Sword is stuck in the ground with only the hilt visible. Supreme Kai asks Gohan to pull it out, and Gohan thinks this sounds like an old story, but decides to give it a try. Back on Earth, the boys are awake. Trunks is sad and sniffling that his father was killed, while Goten cries about his big brother's death. Goku yells at them not to cry, right now they need to learn a new technique so they can get revenge. Goku says they have to hurry, in case Babidi finds this place, so Piccolo suggests they use the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. Goku says that someone can only use that room for at most two days in their life, and they may need it sometime in the future. Goku thinks there should be enough time here, and says it's time to begin.
"
The Zeta Sword,472 (DBZ 278),"
 Gohan turns Super Saiyan to try and pull out the Zeta Sword Gohan asks what will happen when he pulls the Z Sword out, and Kibito says he's supposed to gain tremendous power, probably more than enough to beat Majin Buu. Gohan is amazed, but Kibito assures him he can't pull it out anyway. Shin tells him (nicely) to shut up and watch. Gohan starts pulling, putting all of his might into it and really struggling, but it won't come out. Gohan then stops and grasps his hands, and Kibito smirks. Gohan then transforms into a Super Saiyan, but Kibito doubts it will make much of a difference. Gohan starts pulling again, and he still struggles, but it eventually begins to budge. Gohan pulls it all the way out, shocking Kibito and making Supreme Kai happy.
 Back on the ground, Supreme Kai asks how the sword is. Gohan, no longer Super Saiyan, says it's heavy and all, but it doesn't seem like there's much power in it. He doubts it could really beat Buu. Kibito says of course it can, so long as the wielder is able to use it freely. Gohan asks Kibito to try holding it, and hands the sword over to him. Kibito immediately drops it, leaving a huge dent in the ground, and Kibito can't get it up again. Kibito plays that down, but then yells that he must be able to use the sword freely.
 Goku explains that if they use Fusion to successfully fuse, they should be able to stay that way for thirty minutes. After thirty minutes are up, they return to normal, and won't be able to use Fusion again for a while. Piccolo thinks thirty minutes is too rough. Goku says with those two, thirty minutes should be plenty. Goku asks them to turn Super Saiyan now, but the boys just scowl at him and Goku asks the two what's wrong. Trunks asks where he was when his dad and Gohan were killed. Goku tells them he was unconscious. Hearing that, Trunks thinks he must be a real weakling. Goten says they couldn't get strong by learning techniques from such a weakling who should've helped Vegeta and Gohan fight Buu.
 Piccolo gets angry, but Goku says they're right, he is a weakling. But even if he is weak, he must teach them Fusion, that's the only way if they want to get revenge for Vegeta and Gohan. Babidi contacts the people of Earth again and tells them they found a much larger city to destroy Ma Junior, Trunks, and Goten don't come here right now. Some people within the city realize it's their city, and notice Babidi and Buu in the air. Trunks notices they're being talked about, and Goten says you can see Buu and Babidi if you close your eyes. Piccolo says they're better off not looking.
 Since nobody has contacted them, Babidi has Buu turn the people into chocolate and eat them. Buu shoots out magic, turning the citizens into chocolate bars, and Trunks and Goten can't stand watching. Boo eats his chocolate, and then destroys the remains of the city. Trunks and Goten then call out to him. Babidi is surprised they finally contacted him themselves before Trunks angrily says that in a short time, they'll kill them. Piccolo yells to stop talking to Babidi before their location is exposed. Goku thinks they must really want to train now, and Trunks and Goten each nod in agreement.
"
Goku Meets Boo!,473 (DBZ 279),"
 Z Fighters learn that Buu is going to attack West City Goku begins teaching the Fusion Dance to Trunks and Goten. Goku orders Trunks and Goten to transform into their Super Saiyan states, and then instructs them to let out their complete power. Wishing to show off how strong he's become, Trunks becomes eager and powers up, with Goten following. Observing the training, Piccolo shows disbelief at how strong the two boys have become, while Goku is not as impressed, confusing Trunks. Realizing Trunks is the stronger of the two, Goku orders him to lower his power level to match Goten's.
 Trunks complains at this order, but Goku replies that he has no time to disagree with Goku's methods. All of a sudden, Babidi transmits another message into the minds of all the people of Earth, including the Dragon Team. Still seeking revenge against Goten, Trunks and Piccolo for assisting Vegeta during his battle with Majin Buu, Babidi informs everyone that has learnt the location of one of his targets, Trunks' home in West City, and demands for Trunks to show his presence or else he'll assure that Buu leaves nobody alive once they visit. Knowing that her parents and Trunks' grandparents are still in West City, Bulma pleads to Goku to go down and rescue them. Goku requests that Bulma allow them to be sacrificed, so that he can continue to train Goten and Trunks. He assures her that he'll revive them with Dragon Balls, but Bulma still disapproves of this notion, reminding Goku that the city itself will be totally annihilated, meaning the deaths of millions, not just her parents. Goku says he'll restore the city with their second wish, but Piccolo reminds Goku of the wish made a few days ago, to restore the lives of the people killed by Vegeta at the World Martial Arts Tournament. Goku suggests using their second wish instead to wish for Earth to return to its state before Buu was released. Interrupting Goku, Bulma informs him that they cannot make any wishes, as they cannot find the Dragon Balls without the Dragon Radar, which is in West City. Concerned, Goku quickly changes plans, and orders Trunks to fly home and retrieve the radar before Babidi reaches the city. Goku informs him that he'll fend off Buu and Babidi so they do not reach the city in time. Questioning if Goku can hold off Buu, Trunks zips from the Lookout and heads straight toward West City and his home. Meanwhile, Goku uses his Instant Transmission technique to confront Buu. Just before Goku teleports, Buu and Babidi are making their way to West City, with Babidi showing his disapproval of Buu's speed, yelling at him to slow down or else he'll fall off. Buu grows to show his irritation at Babidi's complaints, but stops dead in his tracks when Goku materializes right in front of them. 
 Goku floats, calm and focused, whilst Babidi shows his surprise, believing Vegeta had killed Goku in their battle. Goku compliments Buu on his unmatched power, admitting that both he and Vegeta were wrong to doubt his abilities. Babidi immediately changes the subject, demanding to know the whereabouts of Piccolo, Trunks and Goten.  Goku bluntly tells Babidi that he isn't here for that purpose, but is instead there to offer them both a firm warning. He notifies Babidi that his targets shall indeed show themselves, but only after completing their training to defeat Buu. Buu and Babidi both laugh loudly at the idea, with Babidi humorously expressing his doubts that anyone, let alone his targets, could defeat Buu with any amount of training. Goku smirks back, as Babidi continues to scream with laughter. Cutting his laughing session short, Babidi refuses to abide by Goku's rules, and once again demands their presence, or else they'll kill people even quicker. Goku informs Babidi he knew that'd be his reaction, and now prepares himself to stall Buu. Babidi giggles, and demands Buu to finally finish off this nuseance. Buu however, is day dreaming and playing in the skies, not listening to anything Babidi is shouting at him. Goku takes notice of Babidi's treatment toward his servant, and asks Buu why does he still obey Babidi and listen to his constant, demeaning insults. Buu himself pauses, and begins to ponder on Goku's point. Babidi threatens Buu with sealing him away back in his cocoon prison, but Buu retorts and says Babidi will not do that, because Goku could easily kill him without Buu in the way. Babidi realizes that Buu's intelligence is growing, and begins to fret over this development. Buu however, wishes to kill Goku, so obeys Babidi's demand, but only for the enjoyment of killing good guys. Goku realizes that he has no choice, and needs to face Buu in combat to continue stalling him. Goku transforms into his Super Saiyan 2 state, as Babidi and Buu look on. Babidi giggles again, recalling Vegeta's transformation into that same form and how it didn't help him. Goku realizes that he now needs to use his back-up plan, a form that goes beyond the form beyond the original Super Saiyan in order to even stand a chance against Buu's might. 
"
Super Saiyan Level 3!!!,474 (DBZ 280),"Piccolo tries to figure out what Goku said, while Babidi thinks it's just nonsense. Goku notices Trunks' ki has stopped moving, and hopes he hurries up. Trunks is sitting mid-air watching the events between Goku and Babidi, so Goku yells out at him to hurry up and get the Radar. Babidi wonders who he was talking to, and figures he has some sort of futile plan. Goku thinks he'll just have to buy more time, and then returns to normal. Buu thinks he's given up, but Goku says he gonna explain Super Saiyan transformations. Babidi doesn't want to know, but Goku starts off in his normal stage and demonstrates Super Saiyan and then Super Saiyan 2.
 Babidi thinks these transformations are meaningless ""and"" Krillin thinks Goku's bluffing.
However, Goku starts transforming, this one not being an immediate change, but goes way beyond Super Saiyan 2. King Kai wants him to stop, or else his remaining time will… Babidi and Buu are shocked, as Piccolo says his ki is rising rapidly. Even Tien Shinhan, way off in the mountains somewhere with Chiaotzu, says the Earth is shaking and wonders what Goku's up to. Goku finally completes the transformation. His hair is much longer, there's a lot more lightning, and he's lost his eyebrows. He apologizes for taking so much time since he's used to this form and calls it Super Saiyan 3. Everyone is amazed, and even Gohan stops his Z Sword training to wonder if that's his dad's ki he can feel. Supreme Kai says it really is Goku, and Kibito can't believe they'd feel his power all the way here in this sacred land. Gohan wonders what is going on. Back on Earth, Buu says Goku's face has gotten scary, but Buu is not scared at all. Babidi thinks this is nothing much, and tells Boo to beat him up, as the entire Earth watches. Goku flies forward, grabs Buu's forelock, and then punches Boo a few times with his free hand. Goku then swings Buu around, letting him go so that Buu crashes into the ocean.
 Buu flies out of the water, and lets off a volley of blasts at Goku. Goku manages to swat them all away, thinking Buu was hardly damaged by his attack, and Buu just used one of Vegeta's techniques, meaning he can pick up his opponent's techniques just from fighting for a little while. Buu stretches his arm out to punch Goku in the face from a distance, but Goku is barely damaged, either. King Kai wants Goku to stop, because using that abnormal power will greatly reduce his time on Earth, and then there will be no one to teach Fusion to the kids.
"
Boo Unbound!,475 (DBZ 281),"The intense battle between Goku and Majin Buu rages on. The powerful Majin proves a worthy adversary for even Goku. Goku eventually ends the battle after witnessing that Trunks has found the Dragon Radar as he reverts back to his normal stage, and tells Buu that he will have a strong opponent soon. After Goku departs, Majin Buu kills Babidi after Babidi angrily berates Buu for letting Goku escape and Buu has finally had enough of Babidi's orders. Back on The Lookout, Goku explains to Piccolo that the Super Saiyan 3 form is only supposed to be used in the Other World and he used too much energy for this world of time while fighting Buu in this state. Piccolo tells him to get Dende to restore his energy, but Goku replies that Dende can not restore the lifetime shortened by using the form and he must soon to return to the afterlife.
"
Goku's Time,476 (DBZ 282),"Majin Buu encounters an attract young girl Majin Buu is finally free from Babidi's control after killing him with a punch and goes on a rampage to celebrate using Flame Shower Breath and Innocence Express to destroy a city. During his rampage, he encounters a frightened Young Girl whom he finds attractive and asks her if she thinks he is attractive. The girl lies and says she does but cringes when he tells her to give him a kiss. Realizing she is lying, Buu spots a magazine and sees a picture of Barry Kahn and gets the idea to change his face to resemble Barry Kahn's in the hope she will find him more attractive, however the terrified girl still refuses to kiss him. Angered by her rejection, Buu calls her a stupid arrogant woman and turns her into caramel candy and eats her. He concludes that it will be boring until the strong guy Goku promised comes and destroys the city with his Angry Explosion deciding that annihilating the Earth should be fun enough until then.
 Majin Buu alters his face to look like Barry Khan in a failed attempt to get the girl to kiss him Piccolo and Goku are watching the destruction from The Lookout, with Piccolo curses himself for being stupid in thinking that Majin Buu would do nothing. Goku points out Buu doesn't plan ahead and just enjoys destruction, which he considers to be the worst thing about him. Piccolo comments that if Majin Buu wanted to he could easily destroy the planet and kill everyone in no time, though Goku thinks it is unlikely as Buu was excited when he told him someone stronger would come in two days and concludes that the Earth will be safe until then, though he feels sorry for the people of Earth. While they are talking Goku reveals that he probably only has an hour left of his remaining time on Earth, as the Super Saiyan 3 form used up most of his energy. He also explains that it is something that should actually only be used in Other World as it uses way too much energy and exhausts the user completely in a place where time flows like Earth. Piccolo suggests having Dende restore his energy, but Goku refuses as there is another reason he wants to go back to Other World (presumably to find out if Gohan is really dead). Suddenly, Fortuneteller Baba appears and says Goku has only 30 minutes left and that he should getting ready to return. Before Goku leaves, Piccolo asks Goku if he could have defeated Majin Buu as a Super Saiyan 3, and Goku reveals he is unsure as Majin Buu's strength is over the charts and thinks its very likely he would have lost against Buu. Piccolo asks why Goku doesn't go out and try it if he is unsure, though Goku reminds Piccolo of the energy issue and points out that as he is no longer a part of this world, it would be best to step back and leave the fight to next generation as you never know when an even stronger opponent will appear. Goku also admits their taking a risk but with super prodigies like Goten and Trunks he thinks it is worth a try. Piccolo tells Goku to give Gohan his regards when he sees him in Other World, causing Goku to say he thinks the worst thing Gohan about being dead is that he isn't able to see Piccolo anymore. Meanwhile, on the Sacred World of the Kai, Gohan continues training with the Z Sword with Shin commenting that he was able to wield the Z Sword in such as small amount of time. Gohan remembers that his father continued to train in the afterlife and that he has to become stronger even if just a little bit as Majin Buu is still alive.
 Back at the Lookout, Trunks finally returns with the Dragon Radar. With little time remaining, Goku and Piccolo begin teaching Goten and Trunks the Fusion Dance. Goku is surprised to find Goten and Trunks are more obedient and respectful than before, causing Piccolo to comment that it seems Goku's Super Saiyan 3 transformation had been helpful with motivating them into cooperating as well.
"
Goku Goes Back,477 (DBZ 283),"
 Goku says they'll have to practice making their ki identical later, and Piccolo asks Goku if he's alright. Goku insists he's okay, while Piccolo contemplates how much energy Super Saiyan 3 uses in the living world. Goku says for now, they'll master Fusion. Once they have their ki identical, they have to both do the Fusion pose exactly the same. He begins teaching them the pose and everyone is speechless, until Trunks says he thinks that’s really lame. Goku says they'll have to both do it with ""left and right symmetry"", but the boys don't know what that means. So, Goku wants Piccolo to try it with him, but Piccolo is quite reluctant… Goku says they'll have to move in reverse, like a mirror's reflection. So, Goku and Piccolo mirror each other's movements, moving toward each other and ending up with their fingers touching. Now it's the boys' turn. Piccolo says that even if Vegeta were alive, he would never have done this, and Goku isn't sure why…
 Buu is flying along, and he yawns, saying he's getting sleepy. So, he lands in a village and decides to make a house so he can nap. But, it's too noisy as people are screaming at his presence, so he'll make it quiet. Buu gathers all of the living things, lifting them into the air and turning them all into clay. Next, he ""cleans"" up, by destroying the surrounding landscape. Buu takes his big mound of clay, and molds it into a very weird house, shaped like a beehive. He climbs inside through a hole in the side and shows everyone around. This is where he eats his food (he's sitting at a table), takes a bath, use the bathroom, brushes his teeth, and sleeps. Buu wakes up and goes to kill again.
 Goku and Piccolo are training the boys, nitpicking at their movements, and Krillin, one of the spectators, wonders about the dance training. Baba arrives, saying that it’s time to go back now, because his time is up. Goku tells Piccolo it's all up to him now, but the boys should have Fusion mastered by tomorrow and Piccolo agrees. Everyone, including Krillin, Master Roshi and Bulma gathers around to say their goodbyes, and Goku tells Chi-Chi not to feel bad, she still has Goten after Chi-Chi asks Goku what is she going to do now that her first son is gone. Chi-Chi thinks he might be killed by Majin Buu, but Goku insists he won't if he masters this technique. Goku says he'll try to give his regards to Gohan in the afterlife, but Videl still insists she thinks Gohan's alive, somehow. Krillin doubts it, since they don't feel his ki, but Goku thinks it's likely. Baba says they really must get going, but Goten seems to want something. Chi-Chi realizes he wants one final hug from his daddy, but Goten just puts his head down. Goku then picks him up and hugs him, and tells Goten to look out for his mother as Goten agrees and Baba tells Goku that they need to leave now. Flying off with Baba, Goku yells back at everyone ""Later, guys!! Let’s meet up again when you’re dead!!"". Goku poofs away, and Krillin smiles, thinking of what a jerk he is.
"
Where is Gohan?,478 (DBZ 284),"Fortuneteller Baba drops Goku off in the Other World, and Goku runs into King Yemma's office to ask him a question. But first Yemma asks Goku what's happening on Earth, as there are quite a few dead people to deal with. Goku says everyone on Earth will probably be coming here, but he wants to know if someone named Gohan came here shortly before the large amounts of Earthlings started coming in. Yemma says he hasn't, and he would've known right away if he saw Goku's son. Goku is glad Gohan's not dead. Yemma says someone even more amazing did come here, though. The Demon Realm king, Dabura. Since he probably would've liked Hell, King Yemma sent him to Heaven. Goku thanks him, and flies off.
 Goku realizes that Videl was right, but wonders why they never felt Gohan's ki. Suddenly, he does feel Gohan's ki, but it's not here. Goku teleports toward it and arrives in the Sacred World of the Kai to find Gohan practicing with the Z Sword. Everyone is shocked to see him. Goku wonders about Gohan's clothes, and then notices Supreme Kai and that other guy who died. Kibito freaks out that there's yet another mortal on this holy ground. Gohan asks why he's here and tells him that his 24 hours aren't up yet, and so Goku explains. Some time passes, and Gohan contemplates everything Majin Buu has done to the Earth. Goku wants to hold the sword for a bit, and says it really is very heavy, swinging it around a bit. Goku asks Supreme Kai if he can stay here until Gohan goes to fight Buu, and also asks if he can have some food. Supreme Kai asks Gohan if he also wants to rest, and so they all head off. Gohan wants to see Super Saiyan 3 after they eat.
 Back on Earth, a whole day has gone by… Piccolo wakes up the boys. He tells them to wash up and get some food so they can resume training. They must completely master Fusion in one day. On the Earth's surface, Majin Buu has already destroyed two-thirds of the people and cities. Buu flies along, spotting a boy walking down a road, and thinks he won't let anyone get away. Buu lands in front of him, but the boy just happily says hello and asks who it is. Buu thinks he should recognize him. The boy says his eyes can't see, and wonders if Buu is supposed to be someone famous. Buu thinks he's dumb and just has his eyes closed. The boy says even opening them he can’t see, he's been blind since birth.
 Buu realizes he isn't scared because he can't see him, and so he magically restores the boy's sight. The boy opens his eyes, and now he can see! He looks at Buu, but he's still not scared, just grateful. Boo is confused, and sits down with the boy for a bit. The boy figures Buu must be a foreigner for having that thing on his head. Buu asks the boy if he thinks he's cool, and the boy supposes he is fairly cool, which makes Boo happy. The boy decides to give him some money as thanks. He was supposed to use this money to buy milk, but all the stores are closed. Buu tries to eat the money, but it’s yucky, so he flies off. The boy is surprised that foreigners can fly. Buu finds a guy loading his car, and turns him into milk and brings it back to the boy. He tells him milk is yummier than money and flies off. Buu then comes across another town, and blows it up, creating a huge smoke cloud as he looks on in enjoyment.
 Meanwhile, Gohan is easily swinging the Z Sword around, and Goku compliments how well he's able to wield it after only one day. Goku bets the sword can cut really well, and wants to test it. He picks up a big boulder, and prepares to throw it at Gohan.
"
The Zeta Sword,479 (DBZ 285),"Goku readies the boulder, and Gohan thinks he can slice it like tofu. But Shin thinks they should test it with something harder and makes a big cube appear out of thin air. He tosses the cube over to Goku and explains that this is the hardest metal in the universe, Kattin Steel. Goku taps it a bit and is quite impressed. He asks Gohan if he's ready, and then throws the block of Kattin Steel at him. Gohan swings the sword at it, but… the Z Sword breaks when it connects with the block. Everyone is completely shocked, and Goku blames it on Supreme Kai, but Supreme Kai says that the legendary sword was supposed to hold the greatest power. Gohan thinks the legend may have been exaggerated, as he drops the sword’s broken remains.
 Gohan does perk up and say his physical strength has gone way up, since the Z Sword was so heavy. Maybe that was the source of the greatest power, and Supreme Kai agrees that Gohan has probably powered up greatly. Goku's unsure if that's enough to beat Majin Buu, though. An old man, in a Supreme Kai outfit, suddenly shows up, scary the heck out of everyone, and says that's not it. Everyone wonders who he is, and the old man says he's a Supreme Kai from fifteen generations ago. A long time ago, a very strong and evil person, not as terrible as Majin Buu, sealed him away in the Z sword. The person was afraid of his ""fearsomeness"". Goku thinks the old man doesn't look so awesome, and decides to test him by shooting a blast at him. It hits Old Kai right in the face and he hits the ground hard.
 Old Kai gets up, and starts calling Goku all kinds of dirty names. Goku figures he's just an old windbag. Old Kai says the bad guy wasn't afraid of his ""power"", but his fearsome abilities. Goku is curious, but Old Kai says he's not telling, sticking his tongue out. Goku offers him some sexy books if he tells, but Old Kai says he can just watch girls bathe or get undressed with his godly eyes. Goku then offers him a chance to touch the breasts or ass of a real woman, thinking he's the same type as Master Roshi.
 Gohan is curious about what he's up to, and so Goku says that when Gohan gets back to the lower world he can ask Videl to do it. Gohan freaks out and objects. Goku relents and asks Old Kai if instead he'd mind an older woman. Goku tells Gohan to tell Bulma the circumstances, and Gohan thinks he can't ask her something like that. Goku asks Old Kai if this ability can beat Majin Buu, and he says it's not definite, but most likely it can. Goku says she could save the universe just by getting felt up a little, and Gohan thinks that's sexual harassment. Besides, and even if they can save the universe, he'll be killed by Bulma. But Goku isn't listening to Gohan and shakes Old Kai's hand.
 Now that it's settled, Old Kai explains his super ability. No matter how amazing of a master you may be, he can bring out all of your hidden power far beyond your limits. Goku thinks he's heard of that ability before, but Old Kai insists no one else can do it well beyond the limits like this. He looks at Gohan, seeing that he was the one who pulled the sword out, and says that he can surely make someone who could pull out that sword and swing it around into the strongest in the universe. Though, he'd thought the one who'd free him from the sword would be a Supreme Kai, not an Earthling. Supreme Kai solemnly apologizes.
 Old Kai tells Gohan to stand there, and not to move. Then, he starts doing some funky dancing, circling around him. Gohan tries to ask about this, but Old Kai tells him to be quiet for this important ritual. Goku asks how long this will take, and Old Kai says five hours for the ritual, twenty hours for the power up. Goku decides to take a nap, while Kibito and Supreme Kai realize they should probably stay awake. Gohan doesn't like this at all. Meanwhile, Trunks and Goten are still practicing Fusion, and Piccolo says they've nearly perfected it. Now, he wants them to test it, and tells them to match their ki exactly. Trunks is doubtful that the two of them can really fuse. Piccolo shouts that it’s time to begin.
"
The Fusion Succeeds...?!,480 (DBZ 286),"Yamcha tells the others that the youngsters are about to try Fusion, and so everyone walks over to watch. Yamcha says they're going to try it outside, since while fused, they could have such an incredible ki that they'd blow up the inner shrine. Krillin is convinced they'll likely become a very strong warrior, but wonders what they'd look like. Master Roshi thinks they already look similar, so they probably won't change too much. But then again, they could look like a completely different ""macho man"". Chi-Chi wonders what their name will be, either ""Gotenks"" or ""Trunten"". Bulma says it won't matter, since they'll only be fused for thirty minutes.
 Piccolo instructs the boys to match their ki, and begin. There's a big flash as the two begin to fuse. Everyone looks up, and standing before them is a large, pudgy kid. Everyone is shocked. Bulma hopes they can return to normal, while Krillin doubts this is the stronger-than-Majin Buu-warrior that Goku mentioned. Yamcha gets it: an eye for an eye, a fatty for a fatty! The kid begins running, but stops five seconds later, panting hard. Master Roshi thinks this was a failure, and Piccolo realizes why, scolding the kid about Trunks having his fingers out instead of a fist. Piccolo tells him to turn back, but he doesn't know how. So, they'll just wait the thirty minutes. Everyone talks to him, and they find out his name is Gotenks.
 After thirty minutes, Gotenks splits back into Trunks and Goten. Everyone tries to talk to them, but Piccolo says they'll have to talk later. Now, they must fuse again. Another flash, and this time a very frail kid appears, and everyone realizes it was another failure. Piccolo scolds them about the finger being off, and thinks they'll have another thirty minute wait, as Gotenks stands there wheezing like an old man. Krillin comments that it seems like the author has been taking it easy up until now, with the panels of the Fusion pose being almost ""copies"" of each other. Toriyama appears behind him, saying that he hopes the Chief Editor will pay him in-full for this page.
 After the flash, a decent-sized, normal-looking warrior appears. Everyone is blown away by his ki, except for the ladies. Piccolo thinks this is great, and in another thirty minutes, they can try it as Super Saiyans. However, Gotenks tells him he's enough to defeat Majin Buu as he is now. Piccolo says he's stupid, not knowing anything about Buu, and he definitely can't win as he is now. Gotenks flies off, ignoring Piccolo's protests. Piccolo thinks he's an idiot, and he'll be killed. Krillin wonders if he can’t actually win, though, as Yamcha agrees that he was certainly very confident. But, Gotenks soon returns all beat up, and everyone falls over. Piccolo says they'll fight Buu tomorrow, but for now, they need more training. Meanwhile, Old Kai continues his funky dancing around Gohan, who looks miserable.
"
The Earth's Secret Weapon!,481 (DBZ 287),"The Earth's secret weapon (Mr. Satan) In one day, Majin Buu has destroyed 80% of the Earth's people and cities. Like a child, Majin Buu thinks it fun when people try to resist him or run away. Most people were killed by explosion, but sometimes when he's hungry, he turns people into candy to eat them up. But the Earth hasn't just watched in silence. The army has made a move, but of course, they couldn't compete at all. Now, everyone knows that it's all futile, and there is only one they can turn to… However, the remaining people haven't completely given up hope. They know via radio broadcasts that a savior has survived. Everyone is awaiting the awakening of that savior…
 Yes. The champion who has been resting in shelter up until now, in order to heal of the fatigue from the World Martial Arts Tournament… The one who overpowered Cell… The strongest in the world, no, the universe! Now… The Earth's most famous and legendary man has awaken. And so, he is finally going to stand up to Majin Buu. Bearing the hope of the few remaining people upon his shoulders… Yes! The strongest warrior, boasting myth-like invincibility… Mr. Satan has at last taken action!!! The Royal Army has flown Mr. Satan to a safe distance from Majin Buu's house. One of the officers asks about Mr. Satan's duffel bag, and he replies that it's full of his secret weapons.
 Mr. Satan throws off his cape and belt, and then calls out Buu in a very quiet voice. The guy thinks Satan's throat must be sore, and so he yells out at Buu for him. Mr. Satan calls him an idiot and says Buu will hear that, and ducks behind a rock. But, Buu doesn't come out, and Mr. Satan tells them to hurry up and leave. Once they're gone, Mr. Satan sneaks along stealthily, holding up a small shrub in front of his face. Once he gets close enough, he tosses a small rock at Buu's house, but nothing happens. Mr. Satan creeps along the outside of the house, peeping into the window to see that it's empty. Mr. Satan then becomes brave, and starts making fun of Buu, since he's not actually here. Suddenly, there's a noise behind him and Mr. Satan drops to his knees, vehemently apologizing. But, it turns out the noise was just a lizard. Mr. Satan is mad that he did all that just because of a stupid lizard, and so he stomps on it.
 Suddenly, Buu appears on the roof, and Mr. Satan bows and humbly greets him when he comes down. Buu asks what he wants to be turned into, hard candy? A biscuit? A gummy? Mr. Satan asks him to hold up, since he has some lovely presents for Majin Buu. Mr. Satan says it's nothing much though, and Buu thinks he'll just kill him then. Mr. Satan quickly retracts this, saying it's high class chocolate. Boo isn't sure what that means, and so Satan explains that it's very expensive, and very delicious. Buu takes a piece, sniffs it, and then eats it. Mr. Satan devilishly grins, thinking of the deadly poison he put in the chocolate. But nothing happens, and Buu says it's even yummier than human chocolate.
 Satan's next present is a GamePoy, and he shows Buu how to play with it. Buu starts to get frustrated because it's too hard, and so Mr. Satan gives him an easier game. Mr. Satan runs away while he plays it, and then sets off a trigger he's holding. The GamePoy explodes, and Mr. Satan says that's ""the end"". But, Buu survives, and thinks that was a fun game. Since Mr. Satan is fun, Buu decides he wants to make him into a servant. Mr. Satan is grateful, and Buu offers him some human candy balls. Satan reluctantly starts chewing them up, saying they're delicious, but then does the ""hey look over there"" thing and spits them out. Mr. Satan then gets Buu to stare off at something else, and while he's distracted, Mr. Satan elbows him in the back of the neck. Buu doesn't even notice and asks what he's looking at. Mr. Satan says he had seen a shadow. Buu says he'll kill it, and shoots a big blast out into the distance.
 Mr. Satan tells Buu he did very well, and thinks they should get their picture taken together. He tells Buu to lye on the ground, as it's the latest fashion, and then Mr. Satan stands over Buu's body for the photograph. Mr. Satan thinks that at least he's gotten a good picture out of this. The two go inside, and Mr. Satan serves Buu some food before washing his back in the bathtub. Mr. Satan hates doing all this, but he'll think of a way to kill Buu yet.
"
Super Fusion!,482 (DBZ 288),"The cover of this chapter shows Gohan, Mr. Satan, Gotenks, Piccolo, and several Majin Buu duplicates. This cover art is also featured in Daizenshuu 1.
 Piccolo finds Super Saiyan Gotenks Goku, who is eating under a tree while Kibito reads a book next to him, asks Supreme Kai if he really thinks Gohan will power up from all this. Supreme Kai thinks so. The funky dancing ritual is now over, and the two of them are both sitting down, with Old Kai's hands facing out toward Gohan. Gohan peeks his eyes open, and notices that Old Kai is asleep, and yells at him. The old man insists he's awake, and says no more talking, then dozes off again. Gohan thinks this is hopeless. Back on Earth, Piccolo wants the boys to try Fusion as Super Saiyans. After last time, Piccolo warns them not to get too cocky if the Fusion is successful. The boys nervously chuckle…
 Piccolo tells them to go ahead and the boys each turn Super Saiyan, matching their ki. After a bright flash, Super Saiyan Gotenks appears. Piccolo says his ki is certainly incredible, but wonders how well he can move. Gotenks says Piccolo's that house will get busted up if he shows him here, so he'll go down to the ground. Gotenks zooms off, and Piccolo reluctantly gives chase. Gotenks flies all over the world, and finally lands and waits a while for Piccolo to catch up. Gotenks says that's his speed, but now he wants to test his power by beating up Majin Buu. Piccolo tries to stop him, but Gotenks flies off again, as Piccolo says he only has one more minute left to be fused. Gotenks arrives at Majin Buu's house, and calls him out. But, poof! They revert to Trunks and Goten, and then run away. Buu comes outside and wonders what that was, but Mr. Satan says it was nothing, as no one would dare talk to Buu like that.
"
The Friends of the Djinn,483 (DBZ 289),"Mr. Satan is crying as he reads ""A Dog of Flanders"" to Buu, who laughs and thinks it was funny. Buu decides it's time to go kill again, now that they're done reading, but Mr. Satan declines to go with him, instead offering to stay home and cook. After Buu leaves, Mr. Satan calls him a dumbass, and spouts off some other little threats. Mr. Satan goes back inside, and pulls some dynamite out of his bag that's strong enough to blow up a tank. Once he presses the ""remote switch"", he'll have saved the world. Mr. Satan hides the dynamite in a pot, and hopes Buu comes back soon. Meanwhile, an old couple is walking along, hoping to hide in the mountains to be safe from Buu. Suddenly, the old woman gets shot in the head by a sniper.
 The sniper tells his cohort that he had always wanted to shoot people, and since everyone will be killed by Majin Buu anyway, he's doing it now. He wants his cohort to snipe the old man next, which he does, and he finds he likes it too. The two of them then hop into their car, and decide to head for the city, where there are more people left. Back at Buu's house, Mr. Satan is busy cooking, thinking about how he'll be a hero, when he notices Buu is returning. Mr. Satan apologizes and says he's still cooking, but Buu has brought a puppy with him. Buu says the puppy isn't afraid and won't run away. Mr. Satan says it looks like the puppy's leg is injured. Buu decides to heal it then, so the puppy can be scared and run away.
 But, instead of running, the puppy acts friendly. Buu doesn't understand, so Mr. Satan explains that the puppy is happy to have been helped, and has taken a liking to Buu. Bu then tries running away, but the puppy happily follows. Buu asks if the puppy really likes him, and Mr. Satan says it seems he does. Buu thinks he must be like Mr. Satan, and Mr. Satan admits to liking Buu also. Buu is happy, and offers the puppy chocolate, but Mr. Satan says chocolate is bad for dogs and he needs dog food. Buu doesn't know what that is, so Satan offers to go buy some. Satan drives a distance away on a scooter, and prepares to blow off the dynamite, but the sight of Buu and the puppy playing makes him change his mind.
 The sniper and his cohort are driving through town, shooting at everything with machine guns. The cohort is worried that Majin Buu could show up, since he's supposed to live nearby, but the sniper insists it's okay because they have these powerful bazookas. Back at the house, the puppy likes his dog food, but Buu thinks it's yucky. Mr. Satan wants to know why does Buu kill people and destroy houses. Buu says it's fun. Bibidi and Babidi said that's how to play. Mr. Satan asks who they are, and Buu says they're his creators, and they're bad. Mr. Satan says if they're bad, he shouldn't listen to them, and shouldn't kill or destroy. Buu asks if he really thinks that stuff is bad, and Mr. Satan says yeah. Buu then promises to not kill or destroy anymore.
 Mr. Satan thinks he really is a hero, and he really has saved the world. The sniper and his cohort are now nearing Buu's house in their car, and the cohort is much more worried than the sniper is. Buu and the puppy are playing with a ball, and Buu throws the ball way out. The puppy chases after it, but is suddenly shot by the sniper from atop a small cliff. The cohort wonders if that's Mr. Satan down there with Majin Buu as Buu looks absolutely shocked.
"
The Creature of Wrath,484 (DBZ 290),"The cohort wonders why Mr. Satan would be with Majin Buu, but the sniper says it doesn't matter; they'll just kill him and be the new heroes. Mr. Satan spots them atop a cliff, but the sniper then fires a rocket at the house. Mr. Satan manages to get away, and they celebrate their victory. But when the smoke clears, Buu is unscathed, and very angry. The sniper prepares to fire again, but suddenly, the cohort is knocked out. Mr. Satan is also very angry, and next beats the hell out of the sniper. Buu calms down, since the bad guys are taken care of, and Mr. Satan heads back toward the remains of the house. Mr. Satan notices that the puppy is still alive, and Buu quickly rushes over to heal him. The two jump for joy, happy that the puppy is okay.
 Dende and Piccolo have been watching from up above, and Piccolo wonders why that windbag is with Majin Buu. Dende seems hopeful that they may not even have to fight, but Piccolo says Buu is still dangerous. Suddenly, the sniper gets back to his feet, shoots Mr. Satan with a handgun from his back pocket, and then runs off. Buu is unbelievably angry now, and is letting off a lot of steam. He puts the puppy down and heals Satan, who thanks Buu for saving him. Buu weakly tells him to run far away with the puppy, or they'll die. Satan doesn't understand, and Buu yells at him to just hurry. Satan runs off with the puppy, as Buu's steam forms into a giant cloud overhead. The cloud then begins to take shape, and everyone is worried about what's happening.
"
Two Boos?!,485 (DBZ 291),"Evil Buu Everyone watches as the cloud transforms into a very thin Majin Buu. ""The evil portion of Majin Buu's strong anger that he held within swelled up greatly, and came out as another Majin Buu… In short, they've split into a pure evil Majin Buu and an innocent Majin Buu…""
 The evil Buu flies over to the sniper, who unloads his handgun into him. Buu merely holds out his hand and blasts the sniper away, leaving a large crater. As Mr. Satan watches on in horror, the evil Buu runs over to the good Buu, and the two exchange a few punches. The evil Buu then kicks the good Buu across the ground, gives chase, and begins beating him up pretty good. The original Majin Buu has no chance of victory… When they split, the majority of the power went to the evil one. The good Buu tries to turn the bad one into chocolate, but the evil Buu blows the beam back and the good Buu is turned into chocolate.
 Super Buu appears The evil Buu picks up the chocolate, tosses it in his mouth and eats it. He suddenly shoots steam from his body as he begins to transform. When the smoke clears, a lean, muscular Majin Buu appears. Mr. Satan wonders what's going on, as Buu stretches and yawns. Buu suddenly starts screaming, sending Satan flying and cracking the ground around him. Piccolo can't believe this turn of events.
"
"The New, Terrible Boo",486 (DBZ 292),"The new Buu looks upward, laughing. From The Lookout, Piccolo and Dende are looking back down in concern. Krillin walks up, asking what is wrong. Piccolo asks if the runt can not feel the energy of Buu's upgrade. Piccolo explains what happened. Kuririn stammers, hoping that the two Saiyan boys in fusion form can take on Buu. Dende is silent, and Piccolo is doubtful.
 On Sacred World of the Kai, Goku wonders if whet he is feeling is Buu's energy, and Supreme Kai confirms it. Gohan asks Old Kai to hurry up with the power-up so he can go fight on Earth. However, the old coot tells the boy to not worry (he is actually reading manga while doing the spell). Gohan is getting very impatient.
 Buu is just standing in place, looking at his hands, and Mr. Satan is scared greatly. The older thrillseeker recovers from Satan's thrashing, scrambles up to get a gun, and he starts shooting Buu. The bullets just pass through the new monster, and the holes seal up again. The monster stretches, laughs, and flies into the villain's mouth. The villain starts to expand and blows up messily. Buu reassembles himself and launches off to kill Mr. Satan. The hero is cowering over Bee. The monster freezes, and then leaves. Satan looks up, then convinces himself that the stupid creature ran away to escape his great power. However, Buu is hovering just overhead. He angrily says ""Sa...ta..n...?"" then flies away. Satan collapses, wondering if the monster remembers him.
 Buu tears over the countryside before zooming straight up. Piccolo realizes that Buu has sensed their energy. Then, the monster reaches the top of the Korin Tower, and grins at Piccolo, Dende, Mr. Popo, Yamcha, and Kuririn.
"
Humanity's End,487 (DBZ 293),"Super Boo lands on Kami's Lookout and insolently says ""Thought so"". Piccolo expects to be killed, but Boo simply says ""Come out"". No one understands him, so the enraged Boo shouts ""COME OUT!!!"". Piccolo asks what Boo means, and the monster replies that he wants to fight someone that can challenge him, as he has sensed a strong power on the lookout. Chi-Chi, Bulma, Videl and the Ox-King run outside to see what has happened, only to recoil in horror when they see Super Boo on the lookout. Boo is getting impatient and Piccolo asks him to wait, since the hidden fighter is not at full power yet. Boo hates waiting, so Piccolo tells Boo to go and kill some humans to pass the time. Boo suddenly smiles and walks around the top of the lookout as everyone looks on in fear, wondering what he's going to do. Boo then returns to Piccolo and gives him a smug grin before raising his arm and firing a barrage of energy blasts up into the air. The blasts then arc down to Earth, and each one kills exactly one person. Dende collapses at the sight of so much death. Boo smiles and says that everyone on Earth is now dead. Realizing that Boo will kill everyone on the lookout if he's not satisfied, Piccolo gives in. However, since the fighter is now sleeping, it will take one hour for him to be ready. Boo asks how long one hour is. Piccolo creates a hourglass full of sand, and says that the fighter will be ready before all of the sand reaches the bottom. Boo studies the thing and answers ""No way"". Piccolo then reveals that Mr. Satan's daughter, Videl, is on the lookout with them. Boo recognizes Mr. Satan's scent and concedes, but states that, if the fighter is not ready within 1 hour, he will kill Piccolo, Videl and everyone else on the lookout. Boo then sits down to watch the sand fall. Piccolo tells Krillin to get Trunks and Goten into the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. In there, 1 hour will last 15 days, hopefully giving the boys enough time to master the Fusion Dance in order to defeat Boo. In the mountains, Chiaotzu and Tien Shinhan are wondering what it was that just tried to kill them. Mr. Satan is walking in the countryside with his puppy Bee, and he wonders what all the fireworks were about.
"
Return to the Room of Spirit and Time,488 (DBZ 294),"
 On Sacred World of the Kai, Goku and Supreme Kai are trying to understand the surge of power they are feeling. Gohan is losing his temper and demands that Old Kai finish with the spell already. The old coot is not letting himself be rushed, and Gohan explodes, powering up and yelling that he wants to fight Super Buu. However, his body has undergone a transformation, and he wonders where this power has come from. The old coot needs more time to finish the spell, so Gohan sits down and meekly apologizes. The old coot returns to reading his manga. Goku asks Kaioshin if Old Kai has really given the boy this power, and Kaioshin is not so sure. Goku wonders how Gohan pulled this off.
 On The Lookout, Goten and Trunks stare at the Super Buu, asking if this is really it. Piccolo confirms it, and then tries to get the boys to train in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber for the equivalent of 6 hours. Chi-Chi takes this chance to go up to Buu, still thinking that Buu killed him, very foolishly slaps him in the face and demands that he return her Gohan. Buu turns Chi-Chi into an egg and steps on her. Goten almost goes berserk, but Piccolo manages to get the boy to train in the Room of Spirit and Time rather than throw his life away needlessly right now, because they will use the Dragon Balls to revive Chi-Chi later. Trunks is sure that they can completely defeat Buu, and Goten is lost in hatred. Goten and Trunks are in the Room of Spirit and Time, and Trunks wants to eat but Goten keeps training, so Trunks runs to join his friend and keep up in power levels.
 On the lookout, Videl asks Piccolo how Buu could know about her father, and Piccolo replies that Buu and Satan had become friends. Videl ponders this, as Buu gets tired of staring at the sand dial. He destroys the clock, and Piccolo asks for just 30 minutes more. But Buu blows a hole in the floor of the lookout, in front of the Piccolo's feet, and demands to be allowed to do some fighting. Piccolo relents, and leads the monster to the center of the palace. Krillin is afraid that Buu will be guided to the Room of Spirit and Time, and Piccolo just looks stonely resolute.
"
The Confidence of Gotenks!!,489 (DBZ 295),"Kamesennin, Dende, Kuririn, and Bulma are trying to understand Piccolo's motive in guiding Super Buu to the Room of Spirit and Time. Since Trunks and Goten are not yet ready, and so on, they will probably lose. However, Dende assures the group that the room can be treated as a trap for Buu, and the Dragon Balls can be used to wish the boys back to life. Further, Kuririn comments that Piccolo is taking his time, so 1 minute in our world is 6 hours in the Room of Spirit and Time. Buu is getting more impatient, wondering why they have not reached the room yet.
 ""Ultra Super Saiyan"" being referred by Trunks Inside, the two boys are tired, and talking about having just finished a bout of fusion mode, and how it feels to go past Super Saiyan level. They discuss the advantages of training in the Room of Spirit and Time and having 1 week of extra training time. With glee, they envision being able to save all their friends and relatives with their great power. Piccolo contacts the boys telepathically to tell them that he is on his way to let Buu into the Room to fight them soon. Goten panics, stating that they just came out of fusion mode. Piccolo assures them that they have 6 hours to sleep and recover. They do this.
 Piccolo asks Buu if he wants supper first. The monster angrily replies that he does not need to eat and that he is tired of all this messing around. They reach the door and go in. Buu looks around, commenting that it is a weird place. He finds the two boys waiting for him. They taunt the monster, but Buu is not impressed. Piccolo silently pleads for the boys to not screw up again. As they start the Fusion Dance, Buu loses his patience and bashes Trunks. Trunks yells at the monster to wait. Buu looks sullen. Goten and Trunks go through the dance, and, with a flash, they turn into Gotenks. Piccolo is happy and Buu waits while Gotenks continues bragging. Buu still is not impressed, while Piccolo believes that the boys have gotten a lot more power. Gotenks attacks Buu and has no effect. Gotenks wants to know what went wrong, and Piccolo does not know, either.
"
The Extreme Confidence of Gotenks!!,490 (DBZ 296),"Gotenks laughs off his first attack, claiming that he was not really trying before. This time, it is for real. He lunges forward again, coming up with original names for his punches and kicks. Eventually, Super Buu bats the boy away, and Piccolo is extremely embarrassed. Gotenks blusters some more, but Buu complains that this has not been fun yet. So the boy announces ""Super Saiyan"" and powers up. Piccolo comments on the fact that the Super Saiyan occurred after the start of fusion. Super Saiyan Gotenks is going to try again but pauses while trying to decide which attack to use. He comes up with something that would, unfortunately, kill Buu after only one shot. Bowing to fate, Gotenks yells out ""Galactic Donut!"" and draws an energy ring in the air. The donut encircles Buu and tightens. The monster roars in pain. Then, he sneers and says ""just kidding."" Buu breaks free and plays Gotenks like a soccer ball. The two bash heads, and Gotenks decides to try yet another fantastic technique. This time, it is the Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack. Buu is stunned, and Gotenks spits out an evil little ghost, the ghost says ""Hi----i. I'm a ghost."" Gotenks claims that he has won.
"
The Kamikaze Ghost!,491 (DBZ 297),"Gotenks' Kamikaze Ghost floats forward, warning Super Buu to leave because it considers itself truly scary. Buu is waiting, Piccolo wonders what kind of attack this is, and Gotenks expects Buu's imminent death. He tells the ghost to go ahead, and it rushes forward. Buu easily blocks the ghost, but it explodes and causes lots of damage to the Majin. Gotenks gloats over the Kamikaze Ghost, and Piccolo tells the boy to hurry up and do it again. Gotenks eventually gets around to spitting out 10 more Super Kamikaze Ghosts, but spends time getting them lined up and counting off. One ghost complains about another nudging it too hard, running the risk of making them explode. When Gotenks is finally ready, Piccolo points out the fact that Buu has already regenerated, and is boredly reading manga and drinking cream soda. Ghosts #1 and #2 are launched, Buu evades them, and they harmlessly blow themselves up. Buu says that he can not be taken out by the same attack twice, so Gotenks gets into a huddle with #3 to #7. He stirs them up with a ""Fight"" cheer, and two ghosts slap hands in preparation, blowing themselves up. The remaining ghosts, except #10, are sent forward, but while Buu is expecting them, the ghosts swerve off and settle down around something they have found. They discuss the ""interesting thing"" they have located, and Buu comes over to check it out. One ghost calls the thing a turd, but the others correct it. When Buu is looking over their shoulders, the ghosts explode. Piccolo is impressed, and Buu has been reduced to a twisted kind of tadpole. #10 is told to go down Buu's throat and blow up, which is what happens. Standing in front of the blast, Gotenks claims that it is all over.
"
The Door Closes,492 (DBZ 298),"Super Buu explodes after Gotenks' attack Goku says Majin Buu's ki has vanished, and Supreme Kai suddenly notices it as well. But they also can't feel the youngster's ki either. Old Kai says they've just been fighting in the alternate dimension of Time. Goku doesn't understand what he means, but then realizes it must be the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. He wonders why they've been fighting in there, and Old Kai explains that the Namekian led Majin Buu in there for some reason. Goku compliments what an awesome Supreme Kai the old guy is, and Supreme Kai admits that he is relatively useless now.
 Gotenks thinks of what a great job he's done, but Piccolo exclaims that Majin Buu will revive himself. They need to burn up all of his flesh. Piccolo helps him out, and after a while they're finished, as Gotenks stomps on the last piece. Piccolo thinks this is great, it's finally over. However, there's a sudden gush of wind up into the sky and Majin Buu begins collecting above them. Buu reforms, and Gotenks realizes frying him didn't do any good after all, noting that Buu looks thoroughly pissed. Piccolo thinks they should have just wiped out Buu with their ki instead of burning him, and then to be sure, they should have destroyed the entrance to this room so that Buu would be sealed away in this world in a different dimension.
 Piccolo asks Gotenks if he can do that Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack again, or maybe some other great technique. Gotenks thinks he still has plenty left, but he wants to scare Piccolo a bit, for fun. Gotenks dramatically exclaims it's all over, he has no more power for other attacks. Buu suddenly grabs Gotenks' leg with his forelock, and starts slamming Gotenks around. Gotenks, hanging upside down, calls Buu ""baldy"", which prompts him to punch Gotenks and send him flying. Gotenks is really angry now, and finally prepares to use his best technique, but… Piccolo, having believed that Gotenks had lost his energy, suddenly destroys the entrance to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.
 Piccolo tells Buu it's all over, because he's destroyed the only entrance between the two worlds and that there is no escape, along with telling Buu that if he kills them, he'll spend eternity alone in this empty world. Buu thinks of his beloved candy, and Piccolo says there's no candy here. Gotenks yells at Piccolo for having done that, since he still had his best technique left. Piccolo yells back at him, bringing up what he said about maxing out, and Gotenks says that it was a joke. Piccolo says this is no time for that, and the two of them call each other idiots. Buu, who hasn't been paying any attention to the two, suddenly starts fiercely screaming. His enraged screams are so loud that a hole opens up in front of him and The Lookout is visible through it.
"
Escape From the Time Dimension,493 (DBZ 299),"Buu, who is just as surprised at this as the others, stares at the hole. Piccolo realizes that just with the power of his ki, he was able to open a dimensional hole. The hole suddenly starts shrinking, and Buu quickly oozes himself through the tiny hole before it vanishes, leaving Gotenks and Piccolo trapped. Everyone back at The Lookout hears something and walk outside, wondering what that noise was. Meanwhile, Goku notices Majin Buu's ki has returned, meaning he's left the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, but the youngsters haven't… Goku really wants to see what's going on. Hearing this, Old Kai materializes a crystal ball and tosses it over to Goku so he can watch the events. Goku looks into the crystal ball and is amazed he can see the Lookout, but then Buu begins to reform. Everyone is shocked to see Buu is back. Buu looks over at them, saying he was getting hungry, and turns them all into chocolate. Goku can't believe this is happening, and Gohan wants to know what's going on, but Goku tells him he just needs to keep concentrating.
 Back in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Gotenks and Piccolo keep screaming like Buu had, but nothing is happening. Piccolo thinks it's no use, and everyone must be dead after all the time they've been in here screaming. Gotenks reluctantly says he'll have to use ""it"" now. Piccolo asks what he's talking about… Gotenks chuckles, saying he'll show him. Gotenks begins charging up until he reaches Super Saiyan 3. Piccolo asks how, but Gotenks doesn't know. Gotenks says he's really strong now, but his face looks villainous, like Piccolo's. But, this is no time for chit-chat, so Gotenks screams and opens up a dimensional hole of his own.
 Gotenks and Piccolo hop through, as Buu is standing there licking his lips from his feast. Buu notices that Gotenks has changed, and Gotenks says he's gotten awesomely stronger. Goku, meanwhile, is impressed that they've reached Super Saiyan 3 so quickly. Piccolo notices that the lookout is all busted up, and asks where everyone is. Buu rubs his tummy and says they're in there, which makes Gotenks really angry. Boo smirks, as Gotenks flies toward him.
"
Super Gotenks!,494 (DBZ 300),"
 Gotenks flies at Buu, headbutting him straight through The Lookout's main structure and out into mid-air, surprising Buu. Gotenks comes at him again and Buu just barely manages to dodge a punch, and then grabs Gotenks' fist and slings him around. He tosses Gotenks through the Lookout floor, knocking off a big chunk of it. Buu screams out with rage, as Gotenks laughs at how mad he is and Piccolo laments over the Lookout's destruction. Buu curls himself up into a ball, and comes flying toward them. Gotenks dodges, and so Buu shoots straight through the Lookout floor out into the air again. Buu continues doing this, until the Lookout is completely destroyed, aside from the floor below them. Gotenks prepares to counter, but Buu busts up their remaining floor from underneath as he does his poses. Piccolo yells at Gotenks to just do it without posing. Gotenks disappointedly obeys and fires his Rapid-Fire Super Donut attack at Buu.
 Gotenks shoots out a bunch of donuts, which surround Buu and trap him into a ball. Piccolo excitedly thinks Majin Buu has been sealed away, but Gotenks says he'll break free soon, so they'll just damage him now. Gotenks wants Piccolo to help, and instructs him to say ""Okay!"" after he says ""Here I go!"" Piccolo reluctantly agrees. Gotenks says, ""Here I go!"", and Piccolo responds with ""Okay!"" Gotenks passes, Piccolo tosses, and Gotenks attacks, spiking the Buu volleyball down toward the Earth. Piccolo realizes he wasn't much help after all. Gotenks flies down after Buu, and notices that he's left a large crater in the Earth, as though a meteorite had crashed own, and laughs.
"
Super Fusion Unleashed!!,495 (DBZ 301),"Gotenks calls Buu out of the crater, knowing that his attack wouldn't be enough to kill him. He tells Buu to hurry up since he won't be able to stay this strong for long, and it’ll be an hour before he can do it again. Piccolo arrives, and Gotenks says maybe he was too strong after all and Buu really is dead. But suddenly a huge blast shoots up from the crater, barely missing Gotenks and Piccolo. Piccolo nervously notes that the blast had enough energy to obliterate the Earth in an instant. Gotenks is mad and decides to fire some Continuous Die Die Missiles down into the crater. Piccolo warns him that he'll blow up the Earth, but Gotenks isn't too concerned since everyone's dead anyway. Piccolo yells at Gotenks that he could end up destroying a Dragon Ball, and if even just one ball is destroyed, then nothing can be restored.
 Gotenks fires his Revenge Cannon Gotenks stops, thinking Buu's probably been weakened anyway. Buu comes flying up out of the rubble, but not really weakened. Piccolo says he really is weakened; although not physically, but certainly in spirit. Buu's never fought anyone this strong before. Gotenks gloats and thinks Buu's scared, but Piccolo scolds him about being careless. Buu flies over and headbutts Gotenks off into the distance, and then chases after him. Gotenks dodges a punch and then hammers Buu into the remains of a city. Gotenks flies at Buu, but Buu shoots a huge mouth blast at Gotenks. As the smoke clears, an angry Gotenks appears, burnt to a crisp. He decides to counter with his own mouth blast, which fries Buu in return. The two take to the ground, and Gotenks gets in a kick, blocks a punch, and gets in another kick, before taking the upper hand and absolutely pounding on Buu. Goku thinks Gohan won't even get a turn at this rate. Gotenks announces he's going to finish this and bust Buu up into tiny little pieces, and he won't be able to recover anymore, because he'll wipe Buu out with his ki this time. But then suddenly, Super Saiyan 3 runs out and Gotenks return to normal…
"
Deep Trouble!!,496 (DBZ 302),"Super Buu begins recovering from his injuries, as a now-depowered Gotenks laughs nervously. Piccolo thinks it's really all over now. Back in the Sacred World of the Kai, Goku asks Old Kai to please hurry, as Gotenks is now utterly helpless against Super Buu. Old Kai says he can go, as he's been done for about five minutes now. Gohan asks why he didn't say so sooner, and the old man says it's more dramatic this way. Gohan realizes he has to hurry, and asks how he can become that warrior of ultimate strength. Old Kai says it's essentially like transforming into that ""Super Whatever"" and focusing a kiai. Gohan concentrates, and unleashes his power, nearly blowing everyone away.
 Gohan hasn't changed much visually, and Goku is amazed that he isn't even a Super Saiyan. Supreme Kai says they need to hurry to the Earth, but Kibito says he'll take Gohan alone. The two of them would just get in this incredible savior's way, and Kibito intends to leave right after he takes Gohan. Goku feels bad that he can't take Gohan himself. He says they won't meet again until Gohan dies and comes to the Other World for good. Goku tells him good luck, to beat up Super Buu, and they then hug. Kibito teleports away with Gohan, and Old Kai scoffs that he didn't even get a thank you for all he's done.
 On Earth, Gohan has a favor to ask of Kibito: he wants different clothes. He wants to fight in the same gi as his late father. Kibito says that's a simple thing, and asks if the color was the same as the excrement of the frogs on Planet Popol. Gohan says it was a ""golden yellow"" color and, in a flash, it's done. Kibito says he'll be praying for him from the Sacred World of the Kai, and Gohan says to give his regards to the two Supreme Kais. Kibito teleports away, and Gohan flies off. Meanwhile, Gotenks' fusion time finally expires, and he defuses back into Goten and Trunks. The two boys are rightfully thinking that they'll be killed now, with Piccolo saying that he'll fight with them, even though it won't do much good anyway. Super Buu then sits down and starts sleeping, much to the three Z-Fighters' confusion. However, they then feel a great ki headed their way, causing Super Buu to wake up in shock.
"
Gohan's Counterattack!,497 (DBZ 303),"Everyone wonders what it is that has such a powerful ki, and Super Buu stands up to look as well. Piccolo thinks it may be a new enemy, until it gets closer and Goten realizes it's Gohan, much to Piccolo's shock. Gohan lands in front of them, and reveals that the Supreme Kai had saved him from Fat Buu and taken him to the Sacred World of the Kai for special training. Piccolo realizes that he didn't recognize him because he's somehow different now, even his facial features have changed subtly. The make-up of his ki is also different, as it seems that any softness has gone. Gohan learns from Trunks that Super Buu murdered everyone on Kami's Lookout, including Chi-Chi, Videl and Dende. Super Buu laughs at this, saying that he enjoyed listening to their screams of terror as he killed them. An enraged Gohan walks up to Buu, staring him down. Buu questions whether he's ""man enough"" to fight him, but Gohan reveals that he's fully intent on killing Buu.
 Super Buu scoffs at this, saying that he's already beaten Gohan before and he'll do it again. Piccolo thinks that Gohan can't possibly win, and the boys prepare to use the Fusion Dance to help out. Gohan suddenly powers up and punches Super Buu in the face, kicks him, blocks a punch, kicks him again, punches him in the gut, kicks Buu into the air, follows after, and then punches Buu towards the ground. Buu lands hard and quickly looks up to try and find Gohan, but he doesn't see him. Buu is shocked to hear Gohan's voice right behind him, and turns to look. Smirking, Gohan tells Buu to give up, as he has no chance of beating him now. Piccolo, Trunks and Goten's jaws drop in astonishment.
"
What's Boo Doing?!,498 (DBZ 304),"Buu is shocked, and Gohan confidentially says it's useless to try and beat him now. Buu realizes it was him after all, but Gohan doesn't know what he means. Buu had felt a strong power very far away, but he can't allow anyone to be stronger than him. Buu screams that he won't allow Gohan to get away with this, and he'll kill him. Gohan says Buu knows that's futile, but Buu merely grins and starts charging up. Gohan suddenly realizes what he's doing, and quickly flies away with Piccolo and the boys as Buu self-destructs. The group lands on a far-off cliff overlooking the destruction, where Gohan says that Buu didn't die when he self-destructed, nor was he trying to kill Gohan with it. Piccolo can't feel his ki at all, and Gohan says he's hiding it. Goten suspects a sneak attack, but Gohan figures he must be planning something.
 Goten and Trunks saying Ultimate Gohan surpasses Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks Trunks figures that, even if Buu is alive, Gohan can easily take care of him. Goten says he's even stronger than their Super Gotenks, and Trunks admits maybe a little. Piccolo asks Gohan how he even got this strong, and Gohan says it's because of an awesome old guy. Gohan then wants to know who has the Dragon Radar, and Trunks say that Piccolo has it. Piccolo says Dende's dead, but Gohan points out a faint ki he sensed: Dende's. The four of them fly off toward Dende, and along the way they spot someone else: Mr. Satan, who desperately wants something to drink as he is walking through the desert with Bee. Trunks wants to leave him alone, but Piccolo thinks they should bring him along. Piccolo picks up Mr. Satan, and Goten carries Bee.
 Piccolo wonders why Dende alone would have survived, since Buu had plenty of time to kill him. Gohan says Piccolo and Gotenks left the Hyperbolic Time Chamber almost immediately after Buu did, so Buu probably didn't have much time. Piccolo realizes he'd gotten mixed up, and it had only been ten seconds in this dimension. Piccolo drops Mr. Satan as he gets excited, but Trunks catches him. Soon enough, they spot Dende, who is excited to see everyone. Dende explains that Mr. Popo threw him off Kami's Lookout when Buu escaped from the Time Chamber, since he must live, and Piccolo thinks Mr. Popo did well. Mr. Satan wonders about this brat with the odd complexion, but Trunks says he's God. Goku is relieved, while Shin wonders about these Dragon Ball things. Back on Earth, Mr. Satan has learned that Videl was murdered by Buu and he is saddened and horrified about losing his sweet little girl, but Goten reassures him that they will bring her back to life with the Dragon Balls. Mr. Satan threatens Goten, saying he'll make him swallow a thousand needles if he's lying. They suddenly feel Majin Buu approaching, and Gohan is curious to see what he's come up with in the last hour.
"
Ambush!,499 (DBZ 305),"Buu lands and smirks, as Gohan thinks nothing seems to have changed. Mr. Satan yells at Buu, saying that Buu has broken Mr. Satan's promise to not kill anybody. Trunks thinks Buu will just run away again. Boo looks over and yells that he wants to fight the youngsters again. Gohan refuses, saying he is Buu's opponent, but Buu insists that he wants to settle the score with them before fighting Gohan. Gohan wonders why, but Buu ignores him and accuses the boys of being too scared. Trunks and Goten each say that they're not, and Piccolo thinks something weird is going on. Trunks tells Piccolo that Buu is too stupid to have any sort of plan. The two then quickly perform Fusion. Gotenks starts off in his Super Saiyan 3 form, calling himself Super Gotenks, the death god of justice. Buu thinks to himself, ""With the youngster's power… and that Piccolo guy's brains…"" Gotenks flies over next to Gohan, and to let him fight. Buu oozes a little bit of his back off into two blobs, and the blobs slide across the ground unnoticed.
 As Gotenks prepares to fight, one blob envelops him, while the other blob takes Piccolo. With a flick of his finger, Buu brings the two blobs back to him. As he absorbs them into his body, he begins to transform. Goku wants Gohan to hurry and kill him now, but Buu's transformation is over before Gohan can react. Buu lets out a sigh and looks down at Gohan with a devilish grin. His forelock is now elongated, extending down to his knees, similar to that of a Super Saiyan 3's hair, and he is wearing Gotenks' vest. Boo thinks aloud that this is truly the birth of the strongest majin. Gohan can't believe this, but Buu says it's all Gohan's fault for getting stronger. He felt Gohan's existence from far away, and thought that he might be stronger, so he started planning. His suspicions were confirmed when they fought, which was when he realized he'd be the strongest if he absorbed Super Gotenks. But, since his power had a time limit, Buu decided to wait until the next chance. Gohan says Buu's stupidity still hasn’t changed, as it would’ve been smarter to just absorb him. Buu realizes Gohan doesn't get it and tells him there's no point of being the strongest if there's no one to fight and killing him is his greatest motivation. Gohan smiles, saying he gets it now.
"
A Turn of the Tables,500 (DBZ 306),"Buu wants to make this fight quick, because of Gotenks' time limit. Gohan thinks Buu was right to absorb Piccolo as well. Gohan kicks at Buu, but Buu catches his leg. Gohan tries with the other leg, but Buu grabs that as well, and Gohan is just hanging there. Gohan shoots a blast with his hand, but Buu leans his head back and dodges it. From there, Buu sends his forelock up between his own legs, so that it grabs Gohan around the neck. He then drags Gohan between his legs, so that Gohan and Buu are now back to back. Buu then faces backwards and punches Gohan off into the distance, followed by a huge blast, but Gohan just barely manages to jump out of the way.
 Buu flies over to Gohan, and taunts him, which angers Gohan. Gohan flies at Buu with a kick, but Buu dodges it by leaning back. He leans so far back that he does a complete somersault, kicking Gohan up into the air. Buu then fires Gotenks' Rapid-Fire Super Donuts, tying Gohan up, and Boo laughs, asking what if feels like to be done in by a friend's technique. In the Sacred World of the Kai, Goku thinks Gohan will be killed for sure. Old Kai says he hadn't calculated this would happen, and tells Goku to go help. Goku says he can't go back to the living world anymore. Old Kai realizes this, and says he'll give his own life so that Goku can live. Kibito protests giving his life to a mortal, but the old man says Majin Buu will certainly come here otherwise. Supreme Kai volunteers instead, but Old Kai says he's still young, while he only has about a thousand years left.
 Buu prepares to use another of their techniques, the Kamehameha, and Gohan breaks free of the donuts just in time to dodge it. Boo is annoyed at his persistence. Meanwhile, back in the Other World, King Yemma comments that he had left this particular soul alone just in case something like this were to happen, and since it has, he's gone and even given him a body again. King Yemma instructs him to go to Earth and help, and he’ll have Fortuneteller Baba take him there. Baba understands. Vegeta smirks, thinking it's funny they'd ask a villain like him to help, even if he only provides a faint hope of defeating Majin Buu.
 Old Kai says farewell, and then keels over. Goku's halo disappears as he is alive again, and he promises not to waste this life. Old Kai suddenly sits up again, sporting a halo, saying to hurry so that he hasn't died in vain. Meanwhile, Buu continues mocking Gohan's persistence to live.
"
Enter a Savior?!,501 (DBZ 307),"The cover of this chapter shows Gohan facing Super Buu, while Mr. Satan arrives in an Imperial Japanese Type 97 Light Tank. This cover art is also featured in Daizenshuu 1.
 This chapter covers some of the battle between Gohan and Super Buu as well as the introduction of the Potara Earrings.
 Buu tells Gohan to take a shot at him. Gohan attacks but Buu dodges and simultaneously knocks Gohan into the ground. Gohan fires a blast at Buu from the rubble but Buu slams it back at Gohan. It causes considerable damage to Earth, and Dende and Mr. Satan take cover. Buu then flies into the hole created by the blast to find Gohan and begins thrashing him. Mr. Satan remarks that Gohan is being pummelled and Dende insists that Mr. Satan take Bee and run. Mr. Satan ignores this suggestion and pulls out his .45 Gun, saying that it will help him.
 Back on the Sacred World of the Kai, the newly-ressurected Goku prepares to teleport to Earth. Old Kai stops Goku and asks him how he plans to beat Buu, doubting that Gohan and Goku together could beat Buu. Goku suggests fusion but Old Kai points out that Buu will not wait for Goku and Gohan to do the dance. Goku asks what he should do and Old Kai says he has an idea and takes off his earrings. He tells Goku to clip one of them on his left ear and explains that if Gohan puts the other one on his right ear, the two will fuse together, just like fusion, but that it will work even better, and that the Potara have been treasured through generations of Kais. Supreme Kai says that he did not know about this and Old Kai tells him that is the reason he is so weak, and to try it with Kibito. Each of them removes one earring and the two begin flying towards each other.
 Meanwhile, Gohan is sent flying from an attack from Buu and lies on the ground, injured. Dende rushes over to heal him, as Buu prepares to finish Gohan off. Gohan returns to his feet, healed, and Buu briefly wonders who the ""shrimp"" who healed Gohan was, but then realizes Gohan has only returned to his previous inferiority. Buu sends a Kiai towards Gohan, then decides to kill Dende. He sends a blast towards Dende and Mr. Satan attempts to shoot it with his gun. The blast is blocked and Mr. Satan assumes it is his own doing and taunts Buu. However, it is revealed that it was Tien Shinhan who blocked it, with a Tri-Beam. Gohan is shocked and Tien remarks that Gohan has grown unbelievably. Buu says that more foes do not matter to him.
 Meanwhile, Supreme Kai and Kibito have fused into Kibito Kai. He basks in his new power and tells Goku he can fight now. Old Kai reminds Kibito Kai that he is still too weak for Buu. Goku says that the Potara is great and asks what its time limit is. Old Kai tells him it does not have the weakness of a time limit, and that it is permanent. Kibito Kai is shocked and Goku worries about the fact that he will be combined with his son forever and may have to attend high school. Old Kai reminds him that is the least of his concerns. Goku prepares again to teleport.
 On Earth, Super Buu has prepared a large ball of ki and announces that he will destroy the planet, daring everyone to block his attack. Tien exclaims that attack is beyond him while Mr. Satan regretfully prepares to shoot and kill Buu.
"
Will the Potara Prevail?!,502 (DBZ 308),"Goku suddenly stops and asks if they should be Super Saiyan first. Old Kai says there's no point, they can do it afterwards. Besides, the stress would be too much for their body and shorten their lifespan. You can only use the Potara once in your life, though. Goku asks if him if he has ever used them. He explains that an ugly Old Witch once took one to try to be a pretty gal, and this is why he's able to do these mysterious things. Kibito Kai interrupts them, saying there's no time for talking. Goku agrees, and quickly teleports away.
 Buu prepares to launch his attack, while Gohan, Tien Shinhan, and Dende are all watch on in shock. Mr. Satan on the other hand closes his eyes and fires his gun, apologizing to Majin Buu. Goku suddenly appears behind Buu, and throws a Destructo Disc, cutting Buu in half and slicing off the end of his forelock. Gohan wonders how his father was able to come back to the living world. Mr. Satan opens his eyes, and thinks he's cut Buu's body all up with that shot. Boo recognizes Goku as the guy with all the weird transformations. Buu says it's no use if he's come to help. Goku grins and very confidently tells Buu he's wrong, because he has an incredible power up item this time. Buu's lower body, which landed on the ground behind Tien, stand back up and kick him hard, knocking him out. Buu's lower and upper body reunite, and Buu smugly comments that while that guy seemed like quite an expert, he was still just a small fry that was taken out with a mere kick. The rest of them are all small fries too. Goku asks why he'd bother restoring himself if that was really the case.
 Buu thinks Goku must really want to die. Goku yells over to Gohan and tosses the other Potara at him, but Gohan wasn't paying attention and misses it. The earring falls in-between some nearby rocks and Goku tells him to hurry and find it, then put it on his right ear so they can fuse and defeat Buu. However, Buu thinks that would still be useless, but he won't allow them to fuse anyway. First he'll kill Goku, but Goku begs him to wait as Gohan searches through the rocks. Buu rushes at Goku, and so he becomes Super Saiyan 3 and prepares to fight. Buu then suddenly stops mid-air, just as Gohan finds the Potara. Buu begins transforming again, until he starts to resemble Piccolo. Goku laughs, thinking it's because Piccolo is now the strongest one inside Boo, since the youngsters have defused. Goku powers down, disappointed that now Gohan alone can defeat Buu like this.
 Buu smirks and says he had an insurance plan, just in case of this. Goku wonders what he means, and Buu points to his forelock that he didn't bother to restore. The severed piece down on the ground then turns into a blob and suddenly envelops Gohan. The Potara drops to the ground, and Goku flies over and grabs it as Buu begins to transform again. The Kaiōshin think it's all over now, as Boo is now wearing Gohan's dōgi. Goku frantically starts looking around. “I was gonna fuse with Gohan… There ain’t no way around it!! Who else could I fuse with… Tenshinhan’s down… Dende ain’t a fighter… Mi-Mister Satan…?!”
"
The Ultimate Combination!!,503 (DBZ 309),"
 Goku imagines Gokule Having just absorbed Gohan and achieving even more power, Super Buu now threatens Goku to find a new person to fuse within under five seconds with the Potara earrings. As Goku begins to panic, he finds Dende and Mr. Satan. Goku begins to imagine the effects of using with both of them, realizing that if he fuses with Dende, the Dragon Balls will cease to exist and have no hope to restore the Earth. After much thought and hesitation, Goku reluctantly decides to fuse with Mr. Satan, yelling at him to catch this earring and put it on. However, before Goku throws the earring towards Mr. Satan, Goku notices a large power level nearby, and recognizes it as the deceased Vegeta's power level, sent back to Earth by Fortuneteller Baba and King Yemma to assist Goku. Greatly pleased, Goku uses Instant Transmission to teleport to Vegeta before Super Buu hits him. When Fortuneteller Baba leaves the scene, confused as to how Goku is alive again (Baba did not witness Old Kai giving his energy to Goku), Goku requests for Vegeta to fuse with him and form the ultimate warrior to combat Buu. Vegeta quickly refuses, feeling embarrassment for Goku hiding his true powers in their battle while Vegeta was a Majin, also explaining he witnessed Goku using Super Saiyan 3 while his soul was stuck in Hell after his failed attack on Innocent Buu. Deciding he would rather die, Vegeta continues to stare at Super Buu who is quickly rushing toward the Saiyans. Goku however, starts to become impatient and starts to yell at Vegeta, informing Vegeta that Buu has eaten everyone they know, including Vegeta's wife, Bulma, and has absorbed his son, Trunks. Vegeta, realizing and enraged that Buu killed his family, now orders Goku to quickly toss him the earring to fuse, making Goku smile. As Vegeta puts the earring on his right ear, Goku just then quickly informs Vegeta the fusion is permanent. While this information angers Vegeta further, he still puts the ring on his ear. As Goku thanks Vegeta for putting his family before his pride, the two fly towards each other, as a large blast of light bursts from their location. Super Buu, just preparing to fire an energy ball at the previously bickering Saiyans, stops his charge, and as the light dimmers, one new warrior is where Goku and Vegeta used to be and greets Super Buu, who is in complete confusion.
"
The Ultimate Fighter,504 (DBZ 310),"Super Vegito gives Super Buu a lesson The newly formed fused Potara warrior decides to name himself Vegito (Vegerot in the VIZ edition), combining the names Vegeta and Kakarot together, the two warriors who created this fusion. Immediately after deciding on his name, Vegito transforms into a Super Saiyan, calling himself Super Vegito. Super Buu however, it not afraid of this new warrior, and immediately begins to charge towards the warrior at full speed. Super Buu fires an Energy Sphere towards Vegito, only for Vegito to easily deflect it back with one arm, with the ball returning to Super Buu, barely missing his head. Despite Vegito's skills, Super Buu still believes he still has the advantage, and once again rushes towards his target, claiming he'll never destroy him. Immediately though, Vegito delivers a powerful kick to Super Buu's nose, giving him a nose bleed. Vegito comments that it would have been better if he did not have a nose, such as before absorbing Vegito's friends and family, Piccolo, Gotenks and Gohan. Super Buu replies by stating the more Vegito angers him, the more Buu will make sure Vegito suffers a truly painful demise. However, Vegito quickly strikes back with a powerful punch, before grabbing his leg and flying down towards the ground, throwing Buu into the rocks below. Meanwhile, on the Sacred World of the Kai, Kibito Kai is amazed at the power the Potara earrings have managed to give to the two Saiyans, with Old Kai commenting that Kibito Kai is foolish and that Vegeta and Goku already have enormous power, but just needed to combine it and properly work together. Back on Earth, Vegito lowers his right arm towards the ground, and from his hand a large beam shoots from it, impaling Super Buu, as Vegito raises him from the rubble back into the sky. Vegito now requests for Super Buu to fight with all his power, and if he already has, he is extremely disappointed by the results. As Buu regenerates and escapes from the beam, he starts to become incredibly frustrated, blowing thick layers of smoke from his head. Super Buu comments that now, even if Vegito is too strong for him, he can not attack Buu because the smoke is far too thick to see anything. However, Vegito still gives Buu a brutal pounding, managing to tear off his antenna. Vegito comments that just watching your opponents with your eyes is not enough, you need to feel their energy. Old Kai begins to become annoyed at Vegito's playful nature with messing around with Buu, and orders him to finish him off. Buu curses the Saiyan fusion as he regenerates back his antenna.
"
Vegerot's Game,505 (DBZ 311),"Now in a complete state of rage after Vegito has managed to counterattack every move he has, Super Buu goes to a new tactic. Super Buu inhales deeply, and starts to create Kamikaze Ghosts, a signature technique that was invented originally by Gotenks, who Buu had absorbed earlier. This new turn in tactics surprises Vegito, as the Ghosts line up, each one looking like their creator Buu. Super Buu then orders the ghosts to charge at Vegito, explaining that if the ghosts touch him, they'll explode, something Vegito already knew. Vegito however easily manages to dodge all the ghosts and destroy them all with a few Ki Blasts. Vegito insults Buu by calling him desperate by using a move children invented, which further frustrates the already angry Buu, who roars in anger. Back on the Sacred World of the Kai, Old Kai, watching Vegito through a Crystal Ball, once again orders Vegito to finish off Buu before it's too late, embarrassingly suggesting that the power Vegito possesses may have made him too cocky for his own good. Super Buu, after once again insulted by Vegito for his lack of power, charges at the Saiyan with a flurry or furious punches and kicks. Vegito however, manages to block all his attacks easily with his mighty speed only using his knees, crossing his arms. Meanwhile, Dende is flying the frightened Mr. Satan and his dog Bee over to the scene of the fight, informing Mr. Satan about the situation. Back to the fight, Vegito manages to deliver a crushing kick to Super Buu's face, now knowing no matter what Buu does, he cannot win. However, Buu starts to grin menacingly, asking Vegito ""if he likes coffee candy."" This response confuses Vegito, how is then immediately turned into a small piece on coffee candy thanks to Super Buu's Transfiguration Beam. Now ecstatic, Super Buu gloats over Vegito's defeat, preparing to eat the Saiyan. Vegito however, still has control, and manages to attack Super Buu as the coffee candy, much to Super Buu's confusion and further frustration. Due to Vegito's now small size, he is even more impossible to hit, as he attacks Super Buu over and over by going through his body and even throat. After a while, Buu learns leaving Vegito as candy will make things harder, and changes Vegito back to normal. Vegito, now bored of playing around, gives Buu ten seconds to say his prayers before he finishes him off. Super Buu during this time remembers the antenna Vegito had ripped off earlier, and uses it to capture and absorb Vegito, who uses a Saiyan Shield to make sure he is not absorbed into Buu's body. Old Kai and Kibito Kai are left in shock, assuming the battle has ended, and Buu has won, now free to destroy the entire universe with unchallenged power.
"
Two Inside Boo,506 (DBZ 312),"Vegeta crushing his Potara earring after Vegito defuses inside Buu Still in shock over Vegito being absorbed by Super Buu, Kibito Kai and Old Kai look on in fear, worried over what Buu's next actions will be. Super Buu, quite surprised the absorption actually worked, begins to slowly smile, and then proceed to manically laugh and dance in joy, insulting the fallen Saiyan while he does so. Old Kai however notices that Buu has not changed in appearance after absorbing Vegito, like he did when he absorbed Gotenks, Piccolo and then Gohan. Buu notices this also, but brushes it off, assuming that the Saiyan will take much longer to digest than the others. With nobody left in his way, Boo rips off the Gi that he got when he absorbed Gohan, and then prepares to destroy every other planet he finds. As Buu laughs menacingly, Vegito, thanks to his Saiyan Shield, is not properly digested into Buu's stomach, and wonders around Buu's stomach to find his fallen friends and family. Old Kai and Kibito Kai figure out that Vegito deliberately wanted Boo to absorb him so he could save his friends, and then destroy Boo. However, in a large burst of light, Vegito defuses, as Goku and Vegeta emerge from the light, completely confused as to what happened. Goku and Vegeta continue to wonder why they defused, as Goku was told once someone fuses with Potara earrings, they can never defuse. Goku assumes that the nasty gasses and air in Boo's stomach have something to do with it, and that they will try to fuse again once they are out of his body. Vegeta however, is pleased by the defusion, as he could not stand being fused with Goku much longer. Vegeta pulls off his Potara earring and crushes it in his palm, sprinkling the pieces on the floor, much to Goku's shock. Goku argues that Vegeta will have to go back to Hell if he is not fused with Goku, but Vegeta still says that living in an eternal damnation is better than being fused with Goku. Goku also breaks his earring with hesitation, knowing it is useless without the other one. Old Kai becomes incredibly frustrated by these turns in events, calling both Goku and Vegeta idiots for what they have done. Vegeta decides to go searching for Goten, Trunks, Piccolo and Gohan in Boo's stomach before Boo decides to decimate the entire planet. Vegeta quickly finds the four contained in large pods, with only their heads visible. As Boo lowers his hand and states he is going to destroy the planet, Goku and Vegeta cut off the pods in Boo's stomach with small energy beams. This causes Boo to transform back into previous weaker forms, until everyone is free, then Super Boo turns back into his much weaker original self before he had absorbed anybody. As Vegeta and Goku prepare to carry their friends and family out of the pod, Vegeta notices the original Fat Boo he had tried to fight and destroy when he was put under Babidi's control. Immediately after though, Super Boo emerges inside of his own stomach, which Vegeta and Goku do not notice, as they discuss if they should free the fat Boo too.
"
Boos Inside Boo,507 (DBZ 313),"Goku and Vegeta continue to discuss if they should or not release the fat Majin Buu trapped Inside Buu. As they are discussing this, Super Buu creates a Super Boo inside his mind to combat and defeat the Dragon Team. Goku suggests that since the fat Boo was turned into chocolate and yet he is still here, possibly all of Goku and Vegeta's friends are there too, like Krillin, Yamcha, Bulma, Videl, Ox-King, Master Roshi, Mr. Popo, all who were turned into chocolate on The Lookout. However, the Super Boo in Boo's mind confronts them and informs Goku he is wrong. As Goku and Vegeta stare in amazement that Boo has managed to appear in his own body, Boo stands his ground and prepares to make the Saiyans suffer for their actions, such as freeing Piccolo, Goten, Trunks and Gohan, thus making Boo much weaker. As Vegeta begins to slightly panic, Goku blames Vegeta for being this powerless against Boo now, due to destroying his Potara earring earlier. Due to Goku spitting out this information, Boo now knows the two cannot combine anymore, and thus has no hesitation to just attack them. Vegeta yells at Goku for revealing this information so stupidly. Super Buu then prepares to attack, as Goku and Vegeta transform into Super Saiyans. Super Boo laughs as he claims that they still have absolutely no chance of beating him. Goku however, threatens Boo by preparing to fire a ki blast at Super Boo's stomach, hoping to cause extreme pain so he will let them go. While carrying his dog Bee and being flown by Dende over to Boo's location, Mr. Satan finds Super Boo standing motionless on a cliff, with Dende noticing that he has transformed back into his original state before absorbing anybody. Back in Boo's stomach, the attack Goku uses did not work in the slightest, only causing a slight dent in Boo's body, with Boo commenting it felt like he had been bitten by an insignificant flea. With no other option, Goku prepares to take on Boo head on. However, Vegeta meanwhile, without either Goku or Boo noticing, has grabbed the fat Boo's shell and has begun to threaten Super Boo he will tear it off. Super Boo suddenly becomes incredibly fearful, and begs Vegeta not to tear the shell, stating he will ""Not be himself anymore"". As Goku ponders as to what it could mean, Vegeta wastes no more time and tears off the shell despite Super Boo's pleas. As the Super Boo inside Super Boo's body liquefies back into Boo in pain, the real Super Boo starts to scream, grabbing his head in agony. As Goku and Vegeta finally grab their unconscious friends and leave the fat Boo behind, they eventually escape through one of the holes in Super Boo's head, growing back to normal size once outside. They immediately turn around and notice Super Boo morphing in shape, as his muscles grow to ridiculous sizes for his body.
"
The Boo of Pure Evil,508 (DBZ 314),"As the evil Super Buu continues to violently scream and morph in size due to the earlier removal of Good Buu's pod in his stomach, Goku, Vegeta, Dende, and Mr. Satan watch in complete confusion, wondering what Boo will become. On the Sacred World of the Kai, Old Kai and Kibito Kai also watch in confusion, although Kibito Kai has more of a clue about what's happening, stating that Boo is morphing back into his ""Original state"". Eventually, Boo finishes his transformation, and is now much shorter in height, with less muscle. Vegeta laughs at his new form, mocking him due to his kid-like size. Kid Buu does not respond to this insult, and instead stares blankly into the sky. Back on the Kai planet, Kibito Kai explains his first encounter with Boo while he was Supreme Kai and explains everything:
 Huge Buu Millions of years ago, the evil wizard Bibbidi created Boo, who he sent to attack millions of planets across the galaxy, despite Boo barely listening to his creator. Supreme Kai, one of the five Kais who ruled over the universe, himself being the Eastern Kai, was the youngest, and the weakest of the Kais, who managed to escape Boo's wrath with injuries. Kibito Kai explains that the Northern and Western Kais were easily destroyed by Boo very quickly, lasting only a short amount of time. The next to die was the burly South Supreme Kai. Kibito Kai explains that Boo transformed into his buff form after absorbing the Southern Kai, the form seen when Boo earlier transformed. Old Kai asks for Kibito Kai to continue, after Kibito Kai turns in sudden sadness. Kibito Kai continues to explain that the next Kai to be absorbed was the Great Lord of Lords, Daikaioh, who loved to eat and had a playful, pure-hearted personality. After Buu absorbed the Grand Supreme Kai, he morphs into the Fat Boo, whose personality becomes much more playful due to his absorbee's personality. Calculating from his info, Old Kai realizes that the original form of Boo, who has now finally reappeared, is the most dangerous form, due to having no compassion or playful traits that Fat Boo had due to the Grand Supreme Kai.
 Vegeta prevents Boo's blast from hitting Earth On Earth, still staring into the sky, Boo suddenly without warning unleashes a deafening scream, much to Goku and Vegeta's surprise. Suddenly, Boo turns his attention to the ground, lowering his hand. He suddenly unleashes a small ki blast, shocking Goku and Vegeta, but Vegeta manages to deflect the blast just before the blast hits the planet. Enraged by Boo's action, Vegeta demands that Boo fight them first before even thinking of wiping out the planet. Boo turns towards them, finally changing his expression into a menacing smile. Boo then raises his hand in the air, and charges a gigantic energy ball, and despite Goku's pleas, Boo launches the attack giggling, preparing to destroy the planet. Goku and Vegeta suddenly become fearful, knowing there is no way they can deflect an attack that large and more powerful than themselves. As Goku notices he only has seconds to escape alive and be able to save Gohan, Piccolo, Goten and Trunks, Goku prepares to teleport to them, and then to the Planet of the Kais, along with Vegeta. As Goku puts his plan into action, he notices Mr. Satan and Dende down below. Not wanting them to die too, he grabs a hold of them, but now realizes he has no time to rescue the others. As Goku prepares to teleport to the Kai planet, Kibito Kai teleports to Earth himself and grabs Goku's hand, teleporting Goku and the others back to the Kai planet, as Gohan, Trunks, Goten and Piccolo are destroyed in the Earth's explosion. As Old Kai cheers their escape with Goku realizing that he has failed to save Piccolo, Gohan, Goten and Trunks and Mr. Satan sees the Kai planet asks that he's really dead, Vegeta scolds Goku for saving Mr. Satan and Bee rather than his own family and friends, as Goku stays silent with a look of sorrow.
"
Battle for the Universe,509 (DBZ 315),"As Goku continues to mourn over the loss of his sons and friends on the Sacred World of the Kai, Vegeta blames Goku for his their sons and Piccolo's deaths, as Kibito Kai and Old Kai look into Old Kai's Crystal Ball to find out what has happened to Boo and the Earth. Old Kai manages to find out that not only were all of Goku's friends killed, but the whole entire planet Earth has been destroyed, nothing left but tiny atoms, with not even Boo in sight.
 Mr. Satan jokes that Old Kai is just a crazy old man, denying the truth, to which Dende angrily replies that Mr. Satan should respect a Kai, and should bow down. Dende explains to Mr. Satan who Old Kai is, and that he is higher than Kami-sama, and Kaio-sama, who are the lords of worlds. Above them stands the Great Lord of Worlds, and above them stands the Lord of Lords, Kaio-Shin, a.k.a, Old Kai. Mr. Satan stands on in confusion, not understanding a word Dende said to him. Mr. Satan explains his disbelief by stating if Old Kai is a god, why can he not destroy Boo. Old Kai whispers how unlikable he finds the ""Champion of the World"". Mr. Satan assumes this is all a dream, as he states that nobody is stronger than him, and that soon he will wake up happy and just the way it was before. Mr. Satan even believes since this is a dream, he can do anything he wants, even fly, as Goku and Vegeta look towards him with embarrassment. As Mr. Satan runs towards a cliff, he raises his fist proudly and states he will destroy the evil Boo for destroying his daughter Videl in his dream, and for ruining everything else. As Mr. Satan jumps from the cliff, performing a pose, he falls embarrassingly to the ground, confused as to why he can get hurt in a dream.
 Vegeta and Goku face Boo Vegeta continues to scold Goku for his decision to save this man at all, as all Goku can do is look on in shock at Mr. Satan's behavior. Vegeta states there is now no more hope due to the Dragon Balls on Earth being destroyed, and all there is left to do is fight to make sure Boo does not destroy Other World. Startled by the news, Old Kai demands to know why there are Dragon Balls on Earth, as he states Namekians are their creators, and thus, only Namekians should have them, calling the Dragon Balls ""Cheat Codes."" Remembering about the Dragon Balls on Namek, Dende suddenly hatches a plan for everyone to use the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive everyone on the Earth. Suddenly there is hope, as even Vegeta cracks a smile at the news. However, Goku has doubts, as he states Namek is far away from their location, and he doubts his Instant Transmission will be enough. Kibito Kai however states his teleportation abilities can take him to any planet, and now Goku starts to cheer. Old Kai however, refuses for them to use the Dragon Balls, stating the Cosmic Order will fall into chaos. Goku tries to persuade Old Kai into letting them use the Dragon Balls, but Old Kai still refuses bluntly. Goku however, remembers Old Kai's perverted hobbies, and says he will get Old Kai a naked picture of Bulma, Vegeta's wife. Goku states that while Bulma is not young anymore, she still has looks that he knows Old Kai will enjoy. Old Kai starts to change his mind at this offer, and eventually gives into Goku's deal, telling Goku he's always ""preferred the more mature ones"". Vegeta overhears this deal and manages to figure out that Goku is talking about Bulma, which drives him furious, shouting into Goku's ear asking why he can not give Old Kai a picture of Chi-Chi instead. Goku replies that if he asked her, she would kill him, and that she's ""quite flat chested"" compared to Bulma. Kibito Kai returns to the Crystal Ball and finds that Boo has finally regenerated after the explosion, and is now loose in space. Old Kai orders Kibito Kai to give Goku and Vegeta is Potara Earrings so they can fuse again, however, even Goku refuses this time around, stating he would rather fight Boo as himself, having a strong feeling his Super Saiyan 3 form will be enough. Vegeta agrees, and congratulates Goku on his decision, finally calling him ""A True Saiyan"". This news, however, completely shocks Kibito Kai and Old Kai, unable to speak at their decision.
 Goku turns Super Saiyan 3 Still in space, Boo manages to locate Goku and Vegeta's energy, and teleports to their location right beside them, giving them all quite a shock and surprise, as Goku states Boo must have learned that ability after seeing Kibito Kai use it. Goku and Vegeta stand their ground, as Goku orders Kibito Kai to teleport everyone else to safety, and that he and Vegeta will combat Boo. As Kibito Kai teleports Dende, and Old Kai to a distant planet, Old Kai looks through his Crystal Ball and starts to boil up over the Saiyans decision not to use the Fusion Dance. Vegeta and Goku discuss who should fight first, so they end up playing Rock-Paper-Scissors to see who gets to battle Boo first. Goku ends up winning, causing Vegeta to walk to the sidelines and wait for his turn, which Goku states he will probably not get. Goku states his disappointment over the events that have occurred the past few days, with Gotenks not being able to destroy Innocent Buu, but Goku realizes quickly Vegeta is not listening. As Goku turns back to his enemy, he notices Boo is sound asleep on the spot, snoring loudly. Goku is insulted by Boo's lack of interest in his opponents, and transforms into a Super Saiyan 3, waking up Boo and beginning the battle for the universe.

Vegeta and Kakarrot,510 (DBZ 316),"As Vegeta watches Goku charged up at Super Saiyan 3, ready to combat the dangerous Boo on the Sacred World of the Kai, he says this battle will determine the universe's fate, and this battle being the most valuable fight yet. On another planet, Kibito Kai, Old Kai, and Dende also watch through a Crystal Ball, all gulping in fear, hoping for the best.
 Kid Buu lands a hit on Goku As Goku stares down his smirking opponent with intimidation, he begins his attack, as Boo jumps into the air at full speed, forcing Goku to fire a quick Kamehameha blast at his opponent, disintegrating all of Boo's lower half. Goku leaps after his opponent, knowing soon he will just regenerate. As Boo regenerates back to normal, with no visible damage or fatigue, Goku with lightning speed double back hands Boo across the head, making him fly into the air. Boo morphs his body into a similar shape of a parachute, and morphs back so he will not hit the ground with too large an impact. Goku charges towards his opponent once again, however, Boo counters this by stretching his foot to attack Goku from underground, knocking the Saiyan back many feet. While Goku recovers from this surprise attack, Boo launches a Ki Blast at Goku, which Goku narrowly avoids by using Instant Transmission. Goku teleports behind the giggling Boo, and kicks him directly on the head, making Boo soar into the opposite direction. However, Boo manages to counter Goku's next planned attack by elbowing Goku in the nose. Goku and Boo then continue to attack each other with a flurry of powerful punches, each blocking and attacking almost evenly.
 Goku bites Kid Buu As the wing brushes past Vegeta's face, Vegeta begins to start a small speech. Vegeta starts by congratulating Kakarot on his amazing power, which Vegeta now admits is far more than his, stating Goku is the only one with the capabilities to combat Boo. Vegeta explains his reasoning for why he could not beat Goku in their previous battles. He explains that it is due to Goku having a pure-hearted reason for his fighting; to protect the innocent from harm's way. Vegeta explains that he now has these intentions too, but still falls behind due to still wanting his kill his opponents, while Goku fought to make himself stronger, and to keep testing himself. Vegeta finally understands how it feels to ""love"" someone else, and thanks Goku for his kind-hearted nature rubbing off on him, although he still feels embarrassment saying this. Vegeta wishes Goku good luck, and that he is the best warrior there is.
 Goku fires his True Kamehameha During Vegeta's speech, Goku and Boo continue to fight in furious combat, as both Boo and Goku end up biting each other, and Goku manages to dodge one of Boo's Transfiguration Beams just barely. Boo then prepares an enormous Kamehameha, bigger in width and size than Boo and Goku. Goku manages to block this attack with minor injuries, and also fires his True Kamehameha, disintegrating Boo again. Goku insults Boo for copying the Kamehameha technique, stating it as his move. As Boo regenerates once again, Goku takes a deep breath and prepares to battle again. Goku however, now starts to feel frustration, angry over Boo's never decreasing ki, and his ability to regenerate every attack Goku throws at him. Vegeta finally steps from the sidelines and joins Goku, offering his assistance. Vegeta suggests that if Goku goes full power now, he will be able to disintegrate and destroy Boo once and for all in one blast. Goku however informs Vegeta that his ki will need a full minute to charge in order to reach max power. As Boo taunts Goku by performing a strange dance, which angers Goku further, Vegeta offers to distract Boo for that one minute while Goku charges, not wanting Goku to hold back anymore, as he's been used to that already. Goku looks at Vegeta in confusion over Vegeta's offer, wondering what to do.
"
Vegeta Puts His Life on the Line!,511 (DBZ 317),"Vegeta powers up As Goku ponders if Vegeta should distract the powerful Buu for the one minute needed to charge his ki to maximum power as a Super Saiyan 3, Vegeta argues that there is no other option available, and this needs to be done in order to eliminate Buu. Goku warns Vegeta by stating if he dies in this battle, due to already being dead from his battle with Innocent Buu, not only will he be gone from Earth, but he will also be erased from existence. Goku wishes Vegeta good luck, and Vegeta does the same, as he transforms into a Super Saiyan 2 and zooms towards Buu, preparing to distract the demon for the time needed for Goku to reach full power. Buu notices Vegeta charging towards him, and stops his ridiculing dance when Vegeta, with brute force, fires an Energy Sphere at Buu, disintegrating his lower half. Buu however shrugs off this attack and continues his assault. Vegeta however, uses everything at his disposal, and fires an energy sphere before following up with a rapid amount of ki blasts in a row, destroying a lot of the rock land of the Sacred World of the Kai, as the fearful Mr. Satan watches, hiding behind a large rock in complete fear, still believing it is still a dream. With a surprise attack, Buu manages to get behind Vegeta, still firing off ki bullets, and double axe-hands Vegeta on the head, knocking the Saiyan down to the ground at lightning speed. Holding his head in pain, Vegeta takes on the full force of Buu's power, being beaten left and right, with Buu being far too fast to attack. Vegeta starts to become fearful, and is amazed that Goku managed to even fight Buu for as long as he did. Vegeta begs Goku to assist him, as he cannot take much more of Buu's brutal poundings, however, Goku still has not reached maximum power. In fact, his power is decreasing, something Goku states should not happen. As Buu kicks Vegeta directly upward into the sky, he uses the Mystic Attack to extend his arm to ridiculous lengths and proceeds to strangle Vegeta, laughing manically while he does so.
 Buu attacks Vegeta Not wanting Vegeta to suffer any longer, Goku decides that he will just have to take on Buu with the power he has got. However, Mr. Satan, rising from his hiding spot, calls out Buu, and threatens to completely destroy him, stating he is no match for the Champion of the World. Mr. Satan feels proud of his own speech, but feels it was wasted, due to him still believing this whole situation is still a dream. Buu listens to Mr. Satan's boasting, and lets Vegeta go, who loses the ki needed to hold the Super Saiyan 2 transformation, and falls to the ground coughing and unable to stand. Buu, now paying full attention to Mr. Satan, who now starts to regret his decision to fight Buu, charges towards Mr. Satan, who manages to dodge Buu's chop attack just by ducking down in fear, as Buu suddenly stops his attack and begins to hold his head in agony, screaming loudly. Goku, now noticing Buu screaming, standing next to Satan, tells Mr. Satan well done for whatever he may have done to make Buu in his much agony. Mr. Satan, believing his large reputation on Earth as made Buu fearful, brags that he is unstoppable, and that Buu does not stand the slightest chance. Buu continues to hold his head in absolute pain, as the battle continues, with one warrior down: Vegeta.
"
The End of Super Saiyan 3,512 (DBZ 318),"The cover of this chapter shows the fat Majin Buu lifting a Dragon Ball platform on which stand Trunks, Mr. Satan, Vegeta, Android 18, Goku, Krillin, Gohan, Piccolo, Goten. This cover art is also featured in Daizenshuu 1 and as a menu screen in Dragon Ball Z: Infinite World.
 As Buu continues to scream in agony on the Sacred World of the Kai, holding his head while panting loudly, Mr. Satan continues to taunt the monster, calling him a coward, and that he should tremble at the Champion of the World's feet. Goku, watching all of this, still trying to charge his ki to full power as a Super Saiyan 3, does not believe that Buu is actually scared of Mr. Satan, and something else must be occurring inside of Buu for him to start screaming in pain. Buu eventually stops screaming, and starts to spit something from his mouth, a small blob which turns into the unconscious fat Majin Buu, who Vegeta and Goku did not retrieve from Super Buu's stomach earlier on. As Mr. Satan shows his confusion, Kid Buu starts laughing, being free from the torture that the fat Buu inflicted on him from the inside to stop him from attacking his friend, Mr. Satan. On another planet, Dende (still watching the battle through a Crystal Ball), explains this information to Old Kai and Kibito Kai, with Old Kai replying that even if the small Buu attacked Mr. Satan, it would be no big loss, showing his dislike for Mr. Satan. Buu, now free from the fat Buu interfering, now walks slowly towards Mr. Satan, showing no remorse, only an evil grin. Mr. Satan, now showing fear, still holds his ground, and has slight confidence he can still win, still believing this is all a dream. Buu delivers a hard punch to Mr. Satan's nose, resulting in Mr. Satan comically rolling over the floor, while screaming and holding his bloody nose. Running a far distance away from Buu, Mr. Satan cowardly tries to intimidate Buu, stating Buu only has one more chance to apologize. Buu, not paying attention to Mr. Satan's demands, bangs his chest like an ape, confusing Mr. Satan, who claims this might be a sign of Buu's surrender. Buu however, still charges towards Satan, making Mr. Satan more frightful than ever. As he closes his eyes and covers his face, preparing for Buu's final strike, Buu is attacked by a small energy beam. Buu looks in the location where the beam came from, and sees the fat Buu, now conscious, standing tall, with an angry expression. Goku, Vegeta (now conscious), and Mr. Satan all look towards the fat Buu in surprise. the fat Buu informs the small Buu that he hates him, and orders the small Buu to leave Mr. Satan, his best friend, alone. As Mr, Satan starts to tear up at Buu's sentence, Kid Buu roars furiously, as the two Buus charge towards each other, resulting in Kid Buu managing to kick the fat Buu in the face. The fat Buu and Kid Buu continue their fight, as Fat Boo recovers from Kid Buu's powerful kick and manages to headbutt Kid Buu directly on the head, resulting in Kid Buu flying back many feet. Kid Buu then uses the Mystic Attack, grabbing the fat Buu by the antenna and slamming him into the ground, resulting in the ground collapsing from the impact and the fat Buu's weight. As the fat Buu stands back up, he fires a small energy ball at Kid Buu, managing to completely disintegrate Kid Buu's left arm and most of the left side of his chest. Kid Buu however, immediately regenerates, as the fat Buu becomes frustrated. Vegeta, still bleeding rapidly and holding his damaged arm, shouts at Goku for taking so long charging, stating he should have been done a while ago if all it took was a minute. Goku replies by stating something is going wrong, and it must be due to this being the first time he has ever used the Super Saiyan 3 form while alive, and that it is putting far too much strain on his body. Goku, now running low on energy, loses the Super Saiyan 3 form, and transforms back into his base form, shocking Vegeta, Dende, Old Kai and Kibito Kai. Meanwhile, Kid Buu and the fat Buu continue their brutal battle, Kid Buu charges towards the fat Buu at full speed, managing to completely obliterate the fat Buu's head and neck. As Mr. Satan looks in shock, the fat Buu regenerates, and continues to battle Kid Buu, but admits to Mr. Satan he will not win, but has to keep trying. Vegeta now deems the situation a disaster. With no energy left, Goku and Vegeta wonder what to do, as brutal force alone will not work against Kid Buu. The battle for the universe's safety is turning towards Kid Buu's favor, with all hope seemingly lost.
"
Vegeta's Plan,513 (DBZ 319),"On the Sacred World of the Kai, the exhausted Vegeta and Goku begin to feel hopeless in their current situation. Kid Buu, the most deadly and powerful villain the Dragon Team have ever encountered, has both defeated Goku and Vegeta in battle, and now has proceeded to brutally pound the fat Good Buu easily. Vegeta, calling Goku an idiot, asks why he de-transformed instead of reaching his maximum power in his Super Saiyan 3 form. Goku answers by stating that his living body must not be able to handle the energy the Super Saiyan 3 form consumes, unlike when he was dead, where it did not put as much a strain on his body. Goku now informs Vegeta there is no way he can reach Super Saiyan 3 again in this condition, putting Vegeta into an even more hopeless mood. Meanwhile, the fat Majin Buu and Kid Buu continue to battle fiercely. As the fat Majin Buu charges towards Kid Buu with a powerful punch prepared, Kid Buu dodges the attack, and elbows the fat Majin Buu in the head, knocking Buu into the ground. Kid Buu proceeds to pull the fat Majin Buu out of the ground by grabbing his antenna, and then hops on his back, and starts to sadistically choke the fat Majin Buu, as the fat Majin Buu struggles in fear, screaming in pain. Mr. Satan, not being able to bear seeing the fat Majin Buu in this much pain, runs towards Kid Buu and directly kicks the Majin multiple times, ordering Kid Buu to let the fat Majin Buu go, or he will not show any mercy. Kid Buu easily slaps Mr. Satan aside by attacking him with his antenna, knocking Mr. Satan back several feet. The fat Majin Buu manages to escape by extending his antenna and slamming Kid Buu into the ground. Kid Buu manages to back-flip over the fat Majin Buu's attempt to turn Kid Buu into chocolate, and blasts the fat Majin Buu through the back, managing to once again disintegrate his head. Kid Buu then tsks the fat Majin Buu while shaking his finger. the fat Majin Buu regenerates, and the fat Majin Buu and Kid Buu proceed to throw multiple punches in another melee brawl, as Goku notices it is only a matter of time before Kid Buu eventually destroys the fat Majin Buu, and then, he will turn his attention back to Goku and Vegeta, not ready to fight him anymore, thus, they will lose easily, and the entire battle will have been lost. Vegeta suddenly, knowing Dende is watching the battle somehow, (through a Crystal Ball), orders him to summon Porunga with the Namekian Dragon Balls on New Namek. Old Kai shows his disapproval of the idea, but Dende replies that this is the best and only option they have. Kibito Kai offers to take Dende and Old Kai to New Namek through with his Instantaneous Movement, which can teleport him to any planet in the galaxy. Goku asks Vegeta of what his plan is, and Vegeta replies with a question, asking Goku how many times he has saved the Earth. Goku replies by stating he does not remember all the times, but he knows it was more than once, and asks Vegeta why he asked that question. Vegeta replies by stating that the Earthlings should repay the favor of saving the universe, as they have been saved multiple times themselves, and it is time for them to contribute. Meanwhile, Kibito Kai teleports Dende and Old Kai to New Namek, as Dende is greeted by Moori, who took over the job of Grand Elder after Grand Elder Guru passed away. Moori and the other Namekians know of the situation, and have already gathered the Dragon Balls for the situation. Dende informs Vegeta that they have already gathered all the Dragon Balls, and Vegeta now replies with the wishes they need to be made:
 1: Restore the planet Earth before Kid Buu completely obliterated it with his large energy ball.
 2: Resurrect everyone who had died since the World Martial Arts Tournament when Babidi and his forces first attacked, except the evil ones.
 Dende feels doubt over this plan, but Goku convinces Dende to go along with the plan. Dende asks Vegeta what the third wish should be, but Vegeta states they can do whatever they want with it, as it is not important. Goku suggests that saying ""Bring everyone back to life who was killed by Buu"" would have been easier. Vegeta however, tells Goku that if he said that, Babidi and Dabura would have come back to life also, and none of the people Vegeta killed himself while he was a Majin would be resurrected either. Dende now just realizes that Porunga can only bring back one person back to life each wish, but Moori informs Dende that the Dragon Balls have been upgraded since the battle against Frieza. Old Kai once again shows his frustration, that not only does the Planet Earth have Dragon Balls, but now the Namekians have modified theirs. Vegeta orders them to go through with the wishes, and Moori summons Porunga, who appears from a large burst of light, towering over the Namekians. Porunga asks for them to make their requests, and Moori asks Dende if he can still speak his native language, Namekian, to which Dende replies he still remembers. Dende asks Porunga to restore the Planet Earth, to which Porunga replies that it is an easy task. Porunga restores the Earth to how it was before Buu decimated it. As Porunga has now restored the planet, he now prepares for the second wish for Vegeta's plan, a plan which will hopefully help defeat Kid Buu once and for all.
"
A Message to Earth,514 (DBZ 320),"With the Earth now restored, thanks to Porunga from the Namekian Dragon Balls on New Namek, Porunga asks Dende what his second wish is. Dende responds in his native language by asking Porunga if he can bring back to life everyone who died on the day of the World Martial Arts Tournament and onwards, except for anyone evil. Porunga replies by stating that while he can do this wish, it will take him some time. Old Kai and Kibito Kai are still in shock that the dragon could even bring back multiple people in one wish to begin with. On the Sacred World of the Kai, Kid Buu and the fat Good Buu continue their brutal and desperate struggle, with Kid Buu managing to overcome each technique the fat Majin Buu throws at him. Kid Buu uses the Mystic Attack to extend his leg to incredible lengths and kick the fat Majin Buu in the stomach, making the fat Majin Buu fly several feet, crashing into the ground. Kid Buu then removes his right arm by simply pulling it from its sockets. Kid Buu then makes his arm fold into a sphere, and the arm, at lightning speed, charges towards the fat Majin Buu, and proceeds to assault the fat Majin Buu by repeatedly hitting the fat Majin Buu back and forth. Vegeta asks Goku if he has noticed the fat Majin Buu's decreasing ki, knowing that the fat Majin Buu will not be able to hold off Kid Buu for much longer, a vital part needed in Vegeta's plan to destroy Kid Buu. Vegeta wonders what is taking Porunga so long with the wish to resurrect the Earth, and orders Dende to hurry up, to which Old Kai replies, through his Crystal Ball that he is getting there, but it will take time. Porunga finishes the wish, and due to this, Old Kai comes back to life also, along with everyone on Earth, and even Vegeta. Goku tells Vegeta that ever since he tried to defend the Earth before from the fat Majin Buu, he is now officially a good-hearted person. Along with the earthlings, the Dragon Team are revived, including the ones who were eaten by Super Buu on The Lookout, and Gohan, Piccolo, Trunks, and Goten, who were killed by Kid Buu. Now that everyone has been resurrected, Vegeta reveals his plan, and why those wishes needed to be made. So that the earthlings can contribute their energy into a Spirit Bomb, with hopefully enough energy to completely decimate Kid Buu once and for all.
 Goku, shocked by this plan, states it will never work if every human only gives a little energy, but Vegeta replies that they will not just give a bit of energy. They will give nearly all of their energy, and including the Z Fighter's on Earth's massive energy levels, the Spirit Bomb should be enough to destroy Buu. Dende asks Vegeta what the third wish should be on the Dragon Balls, to which Vegeta replies it is not needed at the moment. Vegeta requests for Kibito Kai or Old Kai to make him be able to communicate with every human on the planet, to which Kibito Kai states he cannot do that. However, another voice echos, and informs Vegeta he can do it, to which Goku recognizes the voice as King Kai's, pleasing Goku to hear from him again. King Kai thanks Vegeta for thinking the Spirit Bomb, which he created, will be enough to beat Kid Buu, and prepares the connection so Vegeta can talk to every earthling to convince them to give energy. King Kai offers Vegeta the chance to talk to everyone in the universe, but Vegeta declines, stating it will be too much. King Kai gives the signal that Vegeta is now ready, and Vegeta asks if the people of Earth can hear his voice. Vegeta informs the Earthlings of the recent events surrounding Kid Buu and why they have been resurrected, stating Kid Buu is now on a far-away planet and if he is not defeated, everyone will die once again. Mr. Satan, running away from the fat Majin Buu and Kid Buu's struggle, notices Vegeta talking to seemingly thin air, to which Goku demands Mr. Satan to stay quiet, and that Vegeta is talking to all the humans on Earth. Mr. Satan demands that if Vegeta has time to do this, why can not he help the fat Majin Buu in battle, to which Goku and Vegeta ignore this question. Bulma, recognizing Vegeta's voice, lets out a small cheer, but Krillin orders her to stay quiet so they can hear Vegeta's request. Vegeta reminds everyone of the threat Cell seven years ago had on the Planet, and that Buu is far stronger than Cell, and thus, a much bigger problem. Vegeta ends his long speech by requesting each and everyone of them to raise their hands up to the sky, and their energy will go to Goku, and the Spirit Bomb will be made. Vegeta also tells them not to worry if they feel tired after their energy is taken, and that their energy will return shortly after. Now finished with his speech, Vegeta orders Goku to get prepared to collect the energy and get started, to which Goku thanks Vegeta for thinking of this plan, otherwise the battle would have been lost. Goku ascends into the sky and raises his hands, preparing to collect the energy. The Z Fighters, familiar with Vegeta, all raise their hands without question, and the Spirit Bomb is already much bigger than the one Goku made on Earth against Vegeta years ago when Vegeta and Nappa had invaded. Goku realizes all this energy must have come from Gohan and the others, and now waits for the earthlings to get started, as the energy they have now is still not enough. Vegeta manages to hear what every earthling is saying, as they all completely doubt the truth in Vegeta's speech, believing this to be Buu himself, wanting their energy to conquer the planet. Vegeta curses the humans for being so uncooperative, and attempts to convince the humans once again.
"
Just Not Enough,515 (DBZ 321),"On the Sacred World of the Kai, Goku, due to Vegeta's idea, is gathering energy to create the ultimate Spirit Bomb, which will bring an end to the invincible Kid Buu's wrath, and save the universe from impending doom. Despite Vegeta communicating to the entire world through King Kai's assistance, the Earthlings, except the Dragon Team, have refused to give any of their energy, believing this to be another trick of Buu's to steal their energy in order to take over the planet. Vegeta, completely angered by all of their attitudes and lack of contribution, speaks to them all once again, this time raising his voice, ordering them to give their energy now, or they will regret their decision once Buu finds Earth again and goes on another massacre. One man in the snowy regions, despite his friends disapproval, raises his hands to see what will happen. He feels his energy being taken from his body, and he also comes to the conclusion that this must be the work of Buu. Vegeta continues to hear the Earthlings question this action, calling it a lie, which makes Vegeta growl in anger. Meanwhile, the fat Good Buu, still holding off Kid Buu for as long as he can in order to defend his best friend Mr. Satan, is beginning to tire, and cannot even fight back in his now critical condition. Vegeta notices the fat Buu slowly die, so he now prepares to take on Kid Buu himself, despite not having nearly enough ki to even transform into a Super Saiyan, let alone a Super Saiyan 2, which was still not enough to even be equal with Buu. Mr. Satan also notices Kid Buu preparing to annihilate the fat Buu with one final energy attack. Not wanting his friend to die, Mr. Satan grabs a small rock and aims it at Kid Buu's head, and actually hits Buu with the rock, which was not his intention. Although the rock caused no harm to Buu whatsoever, this makes him turn his head in Vegeta, Goku, and Mr. Satan's direction, which makes him spot the Spirit Bomb. Vegeta, now knowing there's no other choice, orders Goku to ask the Earthlings for their energy one final time while he tries to distract Buu. As Kid Buu lets out a fierce roar and charges towards the defenseless Goku, Vegeta teleports near Kid Buu, holding his signature fighting pose. Kid Buu however, with no effort, directly punches Vegeta in the stomach, making Vegeta almost vomit. As Kid Buu grabs Vegeta's hair and prepares to give the Saiyan a brutal beating. Goku once again pleads to the Earth for the energy needed, and that if they do not, they do not care about their own lives. Hearing this voice, many of Goku's old friends from the past give their energy, such as all the villagers from Jingle Village, which include Android 8 and Suno. Goku also receives energy from Bora and Upa, two friends he met when the Red Ribbon Army had invaded their home land. Goku also receives energy from even Android 17, who once wanted to kill Goku as his ultimate goal over seven years ago. The Earthlings seem to trust Goku's voice a little more, but still do not give their energy, believing either Babidi or Buu are playing tricks. As Kid Buu rapidly pounds Vegeta in the face, Goku feels the Spirit Bomb is slightly bigger, but still nowhere near enough to destroy Buu. Mr. Satan, realizing the situation, and now believing this is not all a dream, continues to hear the Earthlings spouting their disbelief. Finally having enough of the Earthlings' rude attitude, Mr. Satan, shouting as loud as he can, tells them all to shut up and give their energy, saying he is sick of their absolute denial of the request. Recognizing their World Champion's voice, all the Earthlings begin to cheer, and assume Mr. Satan is fighting Buu himself, and that Vegeta and Goku are just spectators of the fight between Mr. Satan and Buu. Playing to the lie, Mr. Satan tells them that even Buu is too strong for the World champ, so he needs their help. All the Earthlings now give their energy without hesitation, as many huge spheres of energy ascend into space and onto the Planet of the Kais. As Vegeta is still being slaughtered by Buu's might, Goku receives a huge boost in size to the Spirit Bomb, making the Spirit Bomb four times the size it was a few minutes ago. Mr. Satan looks at the huge shining sphere in total shock, and Goku, now with confidence, prepares to throw the Bomb, but first, orders Vegeta to somehow escape from Buu, so he is not in the way. However, Vegeta is unable to move, and Buu has him cornered. With Vegeta too weak to move, Goku must make a decision: Either delay the Spirit Bomb and risk Buu winning, or throw the Spirit Bomb, and kill Vegeta in the process.
"
Battle's End,516 (DBZ 322),"Kid Buu struggles with the Super Spirit Bomb (Kanzenban version) On the Sacred World of the Kai, Goku holds the gigantic Spirit Bomb made from the energy of every single Earthling on the planet Earth. As he holds it up in the air, he prepares to launch the sphere at the murderous Kid Buu, who had previously destroyed the entire planet before it was restored thanks to the Namekian Dragon Balls, and had managed to easily defeat many of the Dragon Team in combat, including Goku and Vegeta. As Kid Buu stands shocked, gazing at the giant bright sphere in the sky, Goku orders the gravely injured Vegeta to move out of the way, or he will be incinerated along with Buu when the bomb hits. Barely able to move, Vegeta orders Goku to let go of his kind side for a change, and demands that he do what is right, and that he will not hate Goku for destroying his body, if it means that Buu will die. Kid Buu, now growling vengefully, fires a small ki ball towards Goku, who barely manages to teleport away from the blast while still holding the Spirit Bomb. As Goku reappears, Goku notices that Vegeta has disappeared, and while Kid Buu threw the blast, Mr. Satan rescued Vegeta and now carries him away. Mr. Satan now orders Goku to throw the bomb and finish Buu of now before it is too late, and now nothing is in Goku's way. Goku thanks Mr. Satan for his brave move, and states that maybe his title as “Champion of the World” is actually true. Kid Buu now charges a Kamehameha in order to deflect the Spirit Bomb back towards Goku, as Goku now has the chance to unleash the bomb upon Buu. Goku, with a loud scream, tells Buu he will now perish, and fires the Spirit Bomb towards his target. Kid Buu also fires his Kamehameha blast at full power directly on the Bomb, however, the Kamehameha has absolutely no effect, putting Kid Buu in a state of total shock, and fear. As the Spirit Bomb gets closer and closer to Kid Buu, Buu reaches out his hands and catches the Bomb, however, is barely able to stop it from destroying him. Now in a locked struggle, Kid Buu and Goku, (who can still control the Spirit Bomb), attempt to push the Bomb towards the other, each giving everything they have got, however, due to losing all his energy as a Super Saiyan 3, Goku cannot overpower Buu in the struggle, and starts to lose. Vegeta did not count on Kid Buu managing to catch the Bomb when conducting his original plan, and now worries that there may be no hope, even though they have gotten this far.
 Kid Buu destroyed (Kanzenban version) On New Namek, the Namekians begin to worry, watching the desperate battle over Old Kai's Crystal Ball. The Other World worries too, including King Yemma, who has also contributed energy to the Spirit Bomb. Remembering Kibito Kai's teleportation ability, Dende requests to Kibito Kai that he teleport back to the Kai Planet and restore Goku's energy, an ability Kibito, one of the members of the fusion of Kibito Kai, had in his possession. Kibito Kai however replies that he has used all of his energy due to teleporting everyone across so many different planets, putting Dende in a hopeless state. However, Porunga, the Namekians' magic Dragon, reminds them that they have not used their third wish (The first two were used to restore the Earth, and resurrect everyone who had been killed since the World Martial Arts Tournament, except the bad guys). This brings back Dende's hope, as he makes the wish to Porunga to restore Goku's energy to how it was before he battled Kid Buu. Porunga states this is an easy task to perform, and grants the wish.
 Goku and Vegeta after the destruction of Kid Buu (Kanzenban version) As Goku continues to desperately try and stop Kid Buu from throwing the Spirit Bomb back towards Goku, which will destroy Goku, Dende communicates to Goku, and informs him that all his energy should be restored, thanks to the final wish they have just made. Goku feels his energy return to his body, and shouts in joy, thanking the Dragon Balls once again. As Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan, with the added energy of the Spirit Bomb, Goku now greatly overpowers the monstrous Buu, who now starts to feel the pressure of the Spirit Bomb's power. As Goku moves one of his hands forwards, he thanks Buu for the amazing experience of fighting such an incredible opponent, knowing he will probably never get this kind of experience again. Goku hopes that someday, somehow, Buu will be reincarnated as a new being, a person of good, with a pure heart. As Buu now desperately clings to life, Goku gives Buu an honorable salute, and wishes him farewell, before finally putting in all of his energy, which makes the Spirit Bomb too powerful for Buu to hold, eventually letting go, and thus, is completely obliterated, letting out one final howling scream, as every chunk of his body is turned into less than dust. As the Spirit Bomb explodes in a huge display of light, the battlefield becomes quiet. The now even more exhausted Goku breaths deeply, as he looks onto the destroyed fields of the Kai Planet. Buu has finally been killed, and now, the battle has won. Goku, Vegeta, and Mr. Satan, with the assistance of Planet Earth, New Namek, and The Other World, have finally defeated Buu, the most powerful villain the Z Fighters have ever come across. As Goku looks down towards Vegeta, Vegeta coughs as he sarcastically complains Goku took far longer than needed. Then he collapses. As Goku and Vegeta exchange smiles, Goku gives him a thumbs up, as the two have finally become good friends, instead of fierce unfriendly rivals.
"
A Happy Ending... And Then...,517 (DBZ 323),"The battle against Kid Buu is over. The evil Majin has been completely destroyed on the Sacred World of the Kai thanks to the power of the Super Spirit Bomb, with energy from everyone on Earth, along with the help of New Namek and the Other World. Witnessing Buu's destruction through a Crystal Ball, Old Kai, Kibito Kai, Dende and all the other Namekians cheer in complete joy. On Earth, Gohan asks Piccolo what he thinks has happened. Piccolo confirms that he can no longer sense Buu's ki, which means that he is no longer a threat. As Gohan, Goten and Trunks cheer at Goku and Vegeta's victory, Mr. Satan, on the Sacred World of the Kai, asks the worn-out Goku what happened, and if he has killed the evil Buu now. Goku, not saying a single word, looks towards Mr. Satan with a small smile, as Mr. Satan smiles back, almost starting to cry. Mr. Satan, in a proud speech, once again communicates with Earth, playing to their belief that Mr. Satan was the one fighting Buu. He informs them that, thanks to their help, Buu is now dead and they can rejoice in peace. On The Lookout, the embarrassed Videl (Mr. Satan's daughter) starts to cringe at Mr. Satan's egotistical nature, as the other Dragon Team cheer in joy, including Goku and Vegeta's wives, Chi-Chi and Bulma, who are greatly proud of Goku and Vegeta's efforts. Now with recovered energy, Kibito Kai transports Old Kai, Dende and Mr. Satan's pet dog Bee (through the Kai Kai), back to the ravaged world of the Kai, as Old Kai looks in shame at the sacred planet's condition, now missing many chunks. Barking in happiness, Bee runs towards his good friend, Mr. Satan, and jumps into his arms playfully. As Dende rushes to heal Goku, Goku requests that Dende heal Vegeta instead, as Vegeta took much more of a beating by Kid Buu than Goku did, so Dende rushes to Vegeta's side and heals his wounds, stopping his arm from bleeding.
 As Vegeta breathes deeply, Bee runs away from Mr. Satan, smelling something. As Mr. Satan follows the hyperactive puppy, Bee and Mr. Satan find Good Buu, who had held off Kid Buu for an incredible amount of time. Majin Buu now lays dying, with wounds even he himself cannot heal alone. As Mr. Satan pleads to Dende to heal his close friend, Vegeta moves his arm forward and prepares to finish Buu off once and for all with a Big Bang Attack, believing that he might cause another massacre, or he will create another evil Buu, which will probably destroy the universe for sure the next time. Mr. Satan explains that Buu himself was not the monster they wanted to destroy, but his master, Babidi (who Buu had told Mr. Satan about before), and the evil Kid Buu deep inside his heart, controlling him, and that now with Kid Buu destroyed, Majin Buu is fully good, and would not even bat a fly now. Vegeta still ignores Mr. Satan's begging, and decides if he has to, he will destroy Mr. Satan along with Buu. As Vegeta prepares to destroy them both, Goku asks Vegeta to stop, to which Vegeta responds by calling Goku insane, asking if he even remembers what Buu has done. Goku replies by saying that if not for Majin Buu and Mr. Satan's assistance, the entire universe and everyone in it would've been completely destroyed. Goku also states that, if Buu does start his evil ways once again, they will be stronger, and will have an easier time of destroying him if necessary.
 Vegeta still completely disagrees with Goku, and Kibito Kai brings up the point that the humans still remember Buu, and if he is spotted with Mr. Satan, or any of the Z-Fighters, they will be branded enemies of the planet and hunted down like animals. Goku, however, reminds them that if they keep Majin Buu hidden somehow for six months, they can use the Dragon Balls to erase everyone's memories of Buu's evil attacks and the horrible events over the last few days. This plan makes Old Kai once again annoyed, as he repeats himself by stating the Dragon Balls should not be used so freely. Vegeta finally crosses his arms and reluctantly agrees to go with Goku's plan, but still brands him an idiot for doing this. Mr. Satan jumps in joy over the agreement, as Dende heals Majin Buu and they teleport back to Earth thanks to Kibito Kai's ability.
 As Goku, Vegeta, Dende, Mr. Satan, Majin Buu and Bee are transported back to the Lookout, Goku waves Kibito Kai goodbye, and greets his close friends and family, who are all waiting for them. As Goku embraces with his family, giving his younger son Goten a long hug, Bulma and Trunks rush over to Vegeta, still crossing his arms. Dende also gives a hug to Mr. Popo, as Piccolo looks at them, giving a small grin. Many miles away, Tien Shinhan and Chiaotzu, (two friends of Goku), also notice that Kid Buu's presence has vanished, and also smile, proud of their friends. As Videl looks for where her father is, she finds him, but also finds Buu, and screams in terror. As all the Z-Fighters prepare to fight Buu, especially the angered Trunks and Goten, Goku manages to explain that Buu is purely good now, and will not cause problems. As all the gang gather closely, (with some of them, including Oolong, Chi-Chi, Piccolo and Videl still frightened by Majin Buu's presence), Goku explains the entire fight and the whole situation with Kid Buu, as they all realize they have saved the world once again, and have brought peace to Earth for what will hopefully be the last time.
 Trunks, ten years after Kid Buu's defeat Ten years later, Earth is experiencing an era of total peace. No supernatural enemies have emerged ever since Buu, and the Z-Fighters have gone their separate ways, with Goku having become distant from his family and friends. Despite the humans' memories of Majin Buu being erased, the humans remember Mr. Satan for saving them from ""something"". Trunks, now 18-years-old, is flying a Capsule Corporation aircraft over to Gohan and Videl's house, who have been married for several years now. Trunks, however, puts the aircraft back in its capsule, and instead flies to Gohan's house. Gohan has completely retired from fighting to become a scholar, and is now living the peaceful life he always wanted. As Trunks knocks on their house door (with their house being right next to Goku and Chi-Chi's), Gohan opens the door, greeting Trunks. Gohan and Trunks begin to have a conversation, reminiscing on old times. Trunks says he is looking for Goten. Gohan informs him that Goten is with their father and that Trunks' parents are visiting with Goku, something Trunks did not know.

10 Years After,518 (DBZ 324),"The cover of this chapter shows the main characters of the Buu Arc, although they have aged 10 years.
 Goku and Goten are training when Vegeta and Bulma arrive for a visit. Goku quickly greets them, but Bulma berates him for saying hello after they have not seen or heard from him in five years. The conversation shifts to their ages, when Goku says that she looks middle aged and she angrily shouts at him that she still looks good for her age while he and Vegeta do not change in age. Vegeta says that is because Saiyans evolved from a warrior race and retain their youthfulness so they can fight longer. Vegeta asks Goku if he is going to enter in the World Martial Arts Tournament. Goku says yes because he knows someone who is human but as powerful as Kid Buu will be there. Trunks arrives and asks Goten if he is going to enter as well. Goten says he does not want to and was supposed to go on a date on the day of the tournament but Goku is forcing him to cancel it. Goku tries to cheer him and tells him that he will have another date. Vegeta jokes that their sons have become lazy in this time of peace. Goku spots his little granddaughter, Pan, flying towards them. It is revealed that she is already flying around the Earth at her young age. Pan says that she is going to enter in the tournament with Goku and Goten. Bulma tells them that there will be no junior division and that means Pan will have to fight in the adult division. But, Goku assures her that Pan will be alright. Vegeta decides to enter in the tournament as well and forces Trunks to enter or else his allowance will be cut in half, much to his dismay. Goten lets out a cheer that now Trunks is being forced to enter with him.
 On the day of the tournament, all the Z Fighters reunite. It is revealed that Vegeta and Bulma have a daughter named Bulla, who is one year of difference with Pan, making her Trunks' little sister. Krillin asks Goku why he has not kept in contact with them over the years. Goku laughs and says that he got yelled at Bulma for the same thing, and asks Piccolo if he is entering, which he replies no. Goku, Vegeta, Trunks, Goten, and Pan leave their families and friends to register. They then visit with Pan's other grandfather, Mr. Satan, who hugs Pan. Goku also greets Good Buu. Mr. Satan is worried about Pan entering in the tournament because she will be fighting the adults, but Goku says she will be alright. Mr. Satan is then worried about losing and Goku tells him that they will let him win so he can keep his World Champion title. Goten tells Mr. Satan that all the seats have been taken and Mr. Satan promises to give the ""best"" seats to their families and friends.

"Farewell, Dragon World!",519 (DBZ 325),"ドラゴンワールド The cover of this chapter shows Goku with his Power Pole, and on a blue dragon similar to Shenron. It is a homage to the very first volume of the original Dragon Ball manga.This cover art is also featured in Daizenshuu 1.
 As the contestants get ready to face their opponents, the now late-middle-aged World Tournament Announcer asks them to come up to get their matches started. As Goten panics, as he has to fight Good Buu in the first round, Wild Tiger complains that he has to fight Pan, a measly little girl, with Pan responding by sticking out her tongue. Otokosuki, who is facing off against Trunks, slightly flirts with him, promising not to hurt his face, to which Trunks uncomfortably moves away. Vegeta's opponent, a young punk named Nok, begins to taunt Vegeta, calling him an old man, who has terrible hearing, although Vegeta is just ignoring him. Vegeta shuts the man up by slightly knocking his fist on Nok's face, which makes him fly into a wall and land on the grass, knocking him out cold. Vegeta requests that someone tell the superiors his opponent has decided to forfeit.
 Uub enters the tournament ring As the announcer welcomes to the audience to another spectacular show, he informs everyone that whoever wins the tournament will receive the prize money, which has been donated by their world champion, Mr. Satan, as the crowd cheer hearing his name. First up, is Pan vs. Wild Tiger, as Mr. Satan nervously watches the fight, begging his sweet granddaughter not to get herself killed. Pan, to the audiences surprise, completely overpowers Wild Tiger with only one slap, and one kick, knocking Wild Tiger out of the arena unconscious. Pan bows to the crowd, who cheer in absolute amazement.
 Goku attacks Uub Next up, is Goku against Uub, the fighter Goku has been waiting for, ever since Goku destroyed Kid Buu and asked for him to be reincarnated as a good person. Earlier, Uub is found out as Kid Buu's reincarnation, so Goku makes sure that Majin Buu uses his magic to make sure they fight first in the lineup. The Announcer explains to the audience Goku's legendary reputation as a martial artist, also mentioning he has managed to win the Tournament once before. The Announcer also explains Uub's reason for entering the tournament. He comes from a tropical island, and is the oldest of five siblings who work desperately hard to even earn the slightest bit of money needed for food and shelter. Watching above, Bulma comments on Uub's extremely thin physique. Piccolo however, senses what Goku sensed in the boy, and realizes this will probably be the most interesting match. As Goku pulls of a fighting stance, he asks Uub if he is ready for a great fight, to which Uub extremely awkwardly and nervously replies yes. Goku realizes it will take some aggravation for Uub to be able to fight at his best, so Goku begins to throw insults towards Uub, pretending to have been a mean-hearted person this whole time, and insults Uub by stating he is so weak, he will probably end up in a body bag by the time the match has ended. Goku continues by insulting Uub's mother, calling her extremely fat, to which Uub's angrily reacts to. Goku realizes Uub's power is increasing, so Goku continues to further agitate Uub, insulting both his father and mother, also kicking Uub in the face. Uub finally breaks down and yells at Goku not to insult his family, and now charges towards Goku with contempt and anger. Uub delivers a kick, which Goku manages to block. However, the kick actually gives Goku sharp pains in his arm, something not expected. Goku backflips out of Uub's reach and prepares to charge, as both Goku and Uub collide, each delivering incredibly fast punches and kicks, with Uub and Goku managing to block each other's attacks well. Up above, Gohan and Krillin look on in amazement, completely dumbfounded by Uub's abilities, now really curious who he is. As Goku starts to overpower Uub, Uub unleashes a powerful Kiai, knocking Goku several feet backwards into the air. As Goku now floats in the air, the audience and Uub watch in amazement. Goku realizes Uub does not know how to fly, and now apologizes for the insults, explaining that he only said them to get Uub to fight properly.
 Goku decides to train Uub Goku informs Uub that he has known of his latent potential and already great skills for a long time, and has waited for this moment for over 10 years. Now confused, Uub is asked by Goku to train with him for a long time to reach his full potential. Uub answers by saying he can not just leave the tournament, he needs the money to feed the members of his poor village. Goku however, promises that he will get Mr. Satan to pay for all the food and water they need. Now smiling slightly, Uub thanks Goku, but is still not sure. Goku does not give Uub enough time to answer, as he flies towards his family, leaving them a goodbye. Chi-Chi responds that Goku cannot just simply leave them again, as he has done this too many time already. Goku promises to her he will return every so often to check on them, but needs to unlock Uub's powers in case the world needs help from another supernatural powerful force. Goku, now having said his goodbyes, flies next to Uub and asks for him to hop on his back, so they can fly to Uub's tropical island. As the two fly off at amazing speeds, the audience of the World Tournament are left confused, wondering what will happen to the Tournament now that it has been disrupted. Piccolo comments that he has never seen Goku this happy in a long time, and that he must have been waiting for this. Vegeta comments that this is not just about raising a new protector for the Earth, this is so Goku can become the teacher he has wanted to be for so long, and so he can experience the same rush of excitement like when he had when fighting Frieza. Goku and Uub continue to fly, and Goku, in a triumphant manner, raises his arms and yells ""Yeah!"" happily. Goku says Uub should try it, it will make him happier. Uub slightly raises his voice, and tries to yell, but he can not. Goku asks him to try again, but Uub instead shouts ""Yes Sir!"". As Goku and Uub fly off, the begin their own journey, through training. In the Kanzenban edition, two additional pages show Goku giving his Flying Nimbus to Uub while they are leaving Papaya Island.[1] Vegeta then declares he will show Goku defeat sooner or later.
 The story of the Dragon Balls has ended, as Goku finally advances from becoming a naive fighter, into a wise teacher.

 Dr. Slump (Dr. スランプ, Dr. Slump) is a gag manga series by Akira Toriyama that was serialized in Shueisha's anthology comic Weekly Shōnen Jump from January 1980 to August 1984 and eventually compiled into 18 tankōbon. The series helped to launch Toriyama's career and was awarded the Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen and shōjo manga in 1982.[1] The series setting and characters became tied into the Dragon Ball universe after its run was over.
 Senbei Norimaki creating Arale One day in Penguin Village, Senbei Norimaki finishes creating the world's first perfect Android, a little girl that he names Arale Norimaki after successfully hiding her android origins from the Coffee Pot waitress Aoi Kimidori.[2][3] The next day, Arale is enrolled into Penguin Village Middle School where she ends up in Midori Yamabuki's class who becomes Senbei's dream girl. After shocking the entire school with her intelligence and strength, Arale befriends Aoi's rebellious younger sister Akane Kimidori along with Peasuke Soramame and his older brother Taro.[4][5]
 Dr. Slump is set in Penguin Village (ペンギン村, Pengin Mura), a place where humans co-exist with all sorts of anthropomorphic animals and other objects. In Penguin Village lives Senbei Norimaki, an inventor (his name is a pun on Senbei, a kind of rice cracker) and his nickname is ""Dr. Slump"" (a joke that can be seen as similar to nicknaming an author ""Writer's Block."") In the first chapter, he builds what he hopes will be the world's most perfect little girl robot, named Arale Norimaki (a pun on another kind of rice cracker), in scenes obviously parodying the Italian children's classic Pinocchio. Because Senbei is a lousy inventor, she soon turns out to be in severe need of eyeglasses. She is also very naïve, and in later issues, she has adventures such as bringing a huge bear home and having mistaken it for a pet. To Senbei's credit, she has super-strength (and, in a Dragon Ball crossover, she proved to be genuinely stronger than the young Son Goku, prompting him to train harder). In general, the manga focuses on Arale's misunderstandings of humanity and Senbei's inventions, rivalries, and romantic misadventures. In the middle of the series, a continuously-appearing villain named Dr. Mashirito shows up who is based on Toriyama's editor at the time.
 Dr. Slump is filled with puns, bathroom jokes and parodies of both Japanese and American culture. For example, one of the recurring characters is ""Suppaman"", a short, fat, pompous buffoon who changes into a Superman-like costume by eating a sour-tasting (""suppai"" in Japanese) umeboshi. Unlike Superman, Suppaman can not fly well, and instead pretends to fly by lying belly down on a skateboard and scooting through the streets. Also, the policeman Drop-kun in Dr. Slump wears a Storm Trooper helmet, just as in the American movie Star Wars.
 Toriyama drew several short omake included in the Dr. Slump tankōban volumes that supposedly depict actual events on the production of the series, although, as they are often humorous, the level of truthfulness to them is uncertain. In one, he claimed that when he told his editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, that he wanted to make a manga about a doctor, Torishima told him to add a robot. Toriyama originally wanted a very large robot, but as it would not fit in the panels, he instead made it small. When Torishima rejected that idea, he made the robot a girl, knowing Torishima would find her ""cute"". He also stated that Senbei was supposed to be the main character, but his editor told him to make it Arale instead, which Toriyama agrees turned out better. The act of having Senbei and Midori get married came from having nothing else to draw that week, and that it happened quickly because he does not like romance. He went on to state that Torishima does enjoy romance, and that the relationships of Arale and Obotchaman, Akane and Tsukutsun, and Taro and Tsururin were all Torishima's ideas.
 Toriyama did not expect Dr. Slump to last long, as even before it debuted his editor Torishima was asking him what he would draw for his next series. However, it lasted for roughly five years. When Toriyama began Dr. Slump, he worked at home, where he lived with his parents, and had one assistant who worked one day a week. Toriyama has said several times that he typically would not have any ideas for the story for that week's chapter, but would think up something as soon as Torishima called asking. He thought up each week's story as he drew and sent the rough draft to Torishima at Weekly Shōnen Jump headquarters in Tokyo by air courier from Nagoya Airport. After getting the approval of his editor, he began by drawing the lines that stick out of the frames, then the frames themselves, before using a g-pen to draw clear crisp lines at roughly one page an hour. After he had around eight pages finished, his assistant Hisashi Tanaka (田中久志?) (or Hiswashi (ひすゎし?)) came over, although Toriyama stated he only allowed him to color. For color pages, Toriyama first drew them with permanent ink and used water-soluble color pens, before touching up with a wet brush. Later in serialization (around volume 13, as stated in volume 18), Takashi Matsuyama (まつやまたかし?) became his assistant when Hiswashi started his own series, although Hiswashi occasionally still helped out, as did Toriyama's wife when they were close to a deadline. In 2013, Toriyama stated that one of the conditions he agreed to that allowed him to end the popular Dr. Slump, was that he start his next series relatively soon after. He began Dragon Ball roughly three months later.
 In his own words, Toriyama described the scenery of Dr. Slump as having an ""American West Coast"" feel. Toriyama's editor Torishima recalled that when he asked Toriyama why he drew relatively sparse backgrounds, his reply was simply that it was easier that way. However, Toriyama has stated that he was particular about the art, working more hours on it than he would later on Dragon Ball. In an actual chapter of Dr. Slump, where Toriyama and Matsuyama appear, it was revealed that Matsuyama draws most of the backgrounds and houses. Toriyama often used colored paper, a technique fairly common in design, but less-so in manga. He stated that the tournament-type events, such as the Penguin Village Grand Prix and Kick the can contest, were popular with readers and inspired the Tenkaichi Budōkai in Dragon Ball.
 Dr. Slump was originally serialized in the Weekly Shōnen Jump from issue 5/6 of 1980 to issue 39 of 1984 and subsequently collected in 18 tankōbon volumes under the Jump Comics imprint. It was reassembled as a nine-volume aizōban edition in 1990, a nine-volume bunkoban edition in 1995, and a 15-volumekanzenban edition in 2006. Viz Media published an English adaptation of 18 original Dr. Slump volumes from 2005 to 2009, with translation done by Alexander O. Smith. Dragon Ball, though the original Dragon Ball TV program and early manga chapters, are much closer to Dr. Slump in its style and humor.
 After Dr. Slump ended in 1984, the manga's characters of returned for an extended cameo in Toriyama's next series Dragon Ball, in which Arale and Goku briefly team up to help Goku defeat General Blue during the Red Ribbon Army storyline.
 A Dr. Slump follow-up manga was written by Takao Koyama, illustrated by Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru, and serialized in V-Jump from 1994 to 1996 under the title Dr. Slump Returns, But Only For a Little While. It has been collected into four tankōbon volumes.
 To promote the release of the first Dr. Slump & Arale-chan DVD box set, Akira Toriyama illustrated a special one-shot spin-off titled Dr. Mashirito and Abale-chan published in the fourth 2007 issue of the Weekly Shōnen Jump. The story centers around an evil counterpart of Arale created by Dr. Mashirito Jr. and named Abale. Dr. Mashirito and Abale-chan was adapted into a five-minute short shown theatrically alongside the One Piece feature film One Piece Movie: The Desert Princess and the Pirates: Adventures in Alabasta.
 The original anime adaption to the manga was called Dr. Slump & Arale-chan (Japanese: Dr.スランプとアラレちゃん) and ran from 1981 to 1986 and spanned 243 episodes.
 Some of the characters in their appearances in the remake The second anime ran from 1997 to 1999 and featured 74 episodes. In addition to the series, 11 animated films have been made.
 Most of Dr. Slump takes place before the events of Dragon Ball, since all of the characters are in the positions they held at the end of the series during the Penguin Village portion of the General Blue Saga (examples: Tsun Family residing in Penguin Village, Taro being a cop, Midori being married to Senbei and Turbo existing, Obotchaman existing, Gatchan #2 existing, etc.). Daizenshuu 7 states that Arale's creation (which was the beginning of the series) was in Age 745. The Penguin Village portion of the General Blue Saga in Dragon Ball takes place before the end of Dr. Slump since Arale's grade aren't high school seniors yet and on summer vacation when Goku arrives and also by the fact that Arale isn't mayor yet.
 Obotchaman and later Akira uses Turbo's Time Machine to travel 10 years in the future which would be in Age 759, a few years before the beginning of the Raditz Saga.
 The sequel manga, Dr. Slump Returns, But Only For a Little While first appears to be set a few years later after the original series ending (judging by Turbo's age and the ages of the rest of the characters) but the various Dragon Ball cameos make it too difficult to accurately place it (ex: adult Goku appearing in one chapter but the Dragon Ball GT group of kid Goku, Pan, Trunks, and Giru appearing in another chapter taking place not too long after). Additionally, Dr. Mashirito is still alive, despite having perished in the original Dr. Slump manga.
 Many real-world locations and landmarks that do not exist in the Dragon Ball universe are shown and mentioned. 
 In the Dragon Ball Super anime, several Dr. Slump characters are depicted as much younger than they should by the time they appear in Dragon Ball Super which contradicts their older appearances in Dr. Slump stories, which depict inhabitants of Penguin Village in the future. However, it should be noted that Vegeta breaks the fourth wall by directly referring to Arale as a gag character during the episode, indicating that the episode itself is not meant to be taken seriously.
 Other than the major crossover occurring during the General Blue saga and another crossover in Dragon Ball Super, Dr. Slump characters and references have occurred throughout the Dragon Ball franchise. Characters and references from Dragon Ball have also appeared in later Dr. Slump media released during and after Dragon Ball's original run.
 A handheld game by Animest called Hoyoyo Bomber was released as a Game & Watch clone in 1982 in Japan. Another Dr. Slump video game was released in 1983 for the Arcadia 2001. A game for the PlayStation based on the second television series was released on March 18, 1999. Dr. Slump: Arale-Chan for Nintendo DS was released on October 30, 2008; Goku also appears in this game.
 Dr. Slump PS1 boxart Arale appears in Famicom Jump: Hero Retsuden. In Jump Super Stars, Arale and Mashirito are battle koma (playable characters), with the latter as the game's main antagonist. They both return in the sequel, Jump Ultimate Stars, in exactly the same roles. Also, Senbei Norimaki is a Help Koma (support character) that can strengthen Arale if his Koma is adjacent to Arale's Koma in both games, and Midori, Gatchan, Obotchaman and Poop-Boy were added as support characters in Jump Ultimate Stars. Arale also appears as a playable fighter in J-Stars Victory Vs, with Gatchan and Poop-Boy assisting her during certain attacks. The game also features Senbei, Midori, and Turbo Norimaki as NPC's in the game's J-Adventure mode.
 Arale appears as a playable character and Penguin Village is a playable map in Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3. In Super Dragon Ball Z, Suppaman appears in the background of the city level and he will roll off on his skateboard after breaking a telephone booth. Finally, Arale can be unlocked as a playable character in both Dragon Ball: Revenge of King Piccolo and Dragon Ball: Origins 2. Arale Norimaki and Penguin Village appear in the Timespace Rift created by Tekka and Pinich's wish to Shenron in Dragon Ball Fusions where Arale Norimaki appears as a playable character and can perform EX-Fusion with Android 18 to create Arale 18 or Towa to create Towale. 
 Arale-chan on the SH3-27 SSGSS Goku card in World Mission In the Xenoverse series, two accessories called Arale-chan's Cap and Arale-chan's Poop Stick are references to Dr. Slump.
 
In Dragon Ball Heroes and Super Dragon Ball Heroes: World Mission, SSGSS Goku's SH3-27 card has a CAA Super Ability Subspace Summon W called Double N'cha Kameha where SSGSS Goku summons Arale-chan from Subspace to deal massive DMG with her and Goku's Double N'cha Kameha which is a combination of Arale-chan's N'cha Cannon and Goku's God Kamehameha. Additionally, the attack will deal increased DMG &  permanent -100% to target DMG reduction when Goku's own team has 7+ Hero Energy. The Subspace Summon can be triggered when SSGSS Goku is an Attacker from R3 (Round 3) onwards and the Hero Avatar is on SSGSS Goku's team, though it can only be triggered once per battle. This is a list of characters from Dr. Slump that appeared in Dragon Ball related media.

 Dragon Ball (ドラゴンボール, Doragon Bōru) is an adaptation of the first portion of Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball manga. It is composed of 153 episodes around 20-minutes long and ran on Fuji TV from February 26, 1986 to April 12, 1989. The series average rating was 21.2%, with its maximum being 29.5% (Episode 47) and its minimum being 13.7% (Episode 110). Despite its success, Dragon Ball was overshadowed by its more action-oriented sequel series, Dragon Ball Z. Dragon Ball depicted Goku's childhood, while Dragon Ball Z depicted his adulthood. Both are adapted from the same manga.
 Title card in the original Japanese version Dragon Ball started off as a manga series called Dragon Boy. The story depicted a young boy named Tanton and his quest to return a princess to her homeland. The series was a loose adaptation of the Chinese legend Journey to the West, depicting monkey king Sun Wukong. Due to the series' unpopularity, Toriyama re-wrote Dragon Boy, adapting it as Dragon Ball. All the character's personalities were changed except for Goku. The re-adaptation named Dragon Ball became a hit, and was later made into an anime.
 Two initial attempts at releasing Dragon Ball to American audiences failed. The first attempt was in 1989 from Harmony Gold USA (the company that previously dubbed Robotech). It featured strange name changes for nearly all the characters, such as changing Goku to ""Zero"" and Korin to ""Whiskers the Wonder Cat"". It was test-marketed in several cities, but was never broadcast to the general public and has since been referred to as ""The Lost Dub"" by fans.
 The second and more well-known attempt was in 1995 with only the first 13 episodes dubbed and aired in first-run syndication. This release was a joint-production between Funimation, Seagull Entertainment, and BLT Productions, with a dubbing voice cast similar to Funimation's initial dub of Dragon Ball Z. These original 13 dubbed episodes were later released to home video by KidMark as ""Dragon Ball: The Saga of Goku.""
 The earlier 1995 dub's logo, which lasted 13 episodes and also appears on some older home video releases After Dragon Ball Z became immensely popular on Cartoon Network's Toonami block, Dragon Ball was re-dubbed in English by Funimation's in-house ADR studio for redistribution in the U.S. The complete original series aired on Cartoon Network's Toonami from August 20, 2001 to December 1, 2003. Unlike the theme songs for Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball GT, Funimation made English versions of the original Japanese opening (OP) and ending (ED) themes for these episodes and left in the original background music (which they would later also do with their dubs of Dragon Ball Z Kai and Dragon Ball Super). Some insert (IN) songs were taken out or have talking over them.
 The U.S. version of Dragon Ball that was aired on Cartoon Network (before that, it was aired in syndication and on NBC in select cities) had many edits done to it. Most of the edits were digital cosmetic changes, which were done to remove nudity and blood, and dialogue edits. Sometimes, some scenes were deleted altogether, either to save time or cut out strong violence.
 For example, when Goku dives into the water naked to kick a fish he catches for dinner, a digital water splash was added on his groin; on other occasions when he is naked, he has some digital underwear added. Also, references to alcohol and drugs were removed, for example, when Jackie Chun uses Drunken Fist in the 21st World Martial Arts Tournament, Funimation called it the ""Mad Cow Attack"" (coincidentally, there was a real life Mad Cow epidemic shortly after the episode aired). Also, the famous ""No Balls!"" scene was deleted from episode 2, and when Bulma puts panties on the fishing hook to get Oolong (in fish form), they digitally painted away the panties and replaced it with some money. Also, a number of creative changes were made to the dialogue. For example, when Puar says why Oolong was expelled from school, instead of saying that he stole the teacher's panties, they say that he stole the teacher's ""papers.""
 A lot of older fans hated these changes, because they felt it was butchering the original show's humor and dumbing it down. These edits, however, were necessary in order to have the show aired on TV. The DVDs do not contain these edits.
 Aside from censorship-related reasons, FUNimation also sometimes alters dialogue in an attempt to make a scene more humorous in nature. A notable example of this was with General Blue during his fight with Krillin where his banter with the latter was altered to have him make references to Girl Scouts, the Mona Lisa, and also insulting Krillin with ""diaper man"".
 Original author of the manga, Akira Toriyama, held a great deal of respect for the Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z animes and those that developed them. Toriyama also admired the fact that the anime had original stories created by the animation team, and stated that he considered the Dragon Ball anime to be equal in importance to the Dragon Ball manga.[1]

 Main article: Dragon Ball: The Magic Begins
A live-action version of the popular Japanese animated series. An evil king has been stealing the mystical ""Dragon Pearls"" in an attempt to possess them all. When all but one of the pearls has been stolen, the former guardians of the magic jewels decide to band together and take action. Led by a pig-headed wizard and a half-turtle martial arts master, the team takes on the king's army in a desperate bid to stop him from gaining control of the pearls.
 Made in Taiwan and released in 1991, this feature has actually been released in the US as Dragon Ball: The Magic Begins (originally titled Xin Qi long zhu Shen long de chuan shuo, or New Dragon Ball: The Legend of Shenlong). While this movie does not follow Toriyama's concept exactly, it is a lot closer to it than it is to any traditional Chinese legends.
 Main article: Dragonball Evolution
A live-action version of the series, made in the United States. The movie retains the basic notion of Dragon Ball, but there are several major changes in the story and characters. The movie depicts Goku's training and his confrontation with Lord Piccolo.

 Dragon Ball GT (ドラゴンボールＧＴ, Doragon Bōru Jī Tī, GT standing for ""Grand Tour"", commonly abbreviated as DBGT) is one of two sequels to Dragon Ball Z, whose material is produced only by Toei Animation, and is not adapted from a preexisting manga series. The Dragon Ball GT series is the shortest of the Dragon Ball series, consisting of only 64 episodes; as opposed to its predecessor, Dragon Ball Z, which consisted of 291 episodes, Dragon Ball, which consisted of 153, and its successor series Dragon Ball Super, with 131 episodes. The series spanned 64 episodes and is concluded by the TV special Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy.
 The GT logo, designed by Akira Toriyama (Perfect Files) The series continues the adventures of Goku, who is turned back into a child by Emperor Pilaf accidentally wishing this using the Black Star Dragon Balls in the beginning of the series and is forced to travel across the galaxy to retrieve them. The first half of the series focuses on Goku, Pan, and Trunks, while the second half brings back most of the prominent characters from Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. The series follows the Dragon Team against far more powerful foes such as the Luud Cult, the Machine Mutants, Baby, Super 17, and the Shadow Dragons.
 The series is most commonly referred to as taking place 5 years after the Peaceful World Saga,[1][2] though in promotional material for the English dub it was referred to as occurring 10 years later.[3][4] It was also on one occasion instead referred to as taking place six years later.[5]
 GT main characters as designed by Akira Toriyama The first two anime series were directly based off the Dragon Ball manga, which took much longer to produce than the anime did. This often resulted in ""filler""; a notable instance being that the end of Goku's battle with Frieza lasts much longer than Frieza's predicted ""five minutes"". Since Dragon Ball GT was not based on the manga, no filler was required. As a result, four entire sagas (the Black Star Dragon Ball Saga, the Baby Saga, the Super 17 Saga, and the Shadow Dragon Saga) were completed in only 64 episodes. The music for Dragon Ball GT was composed and written by Akihito Tokunaga, replacing Shunsuke Kikuchi who is now retired after composing his last score for the final episode of Dragon Ball Z and the character designs for Dragon Ball GT were created by Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru.
 Dragon Ball GT began on Fuji TV at 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday, February 7, 1996, exactly one week after the final episode of Dragon Ball Z. It ran for 64 episodes, the last of which aired on November 19, 1997. The series average rating was 14.6%, with its maximum being 19.7% (Episode 02) and its minimum being 9.6% (Episode 21). The series has also been aired across Japan by the anime television network, Animax, where it is currently being regularly broadcast. Unlike the Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z series, the creator Akira Toriyama had only minor involvement in the show's early stages, setting forth the initial premise of the series, as well as creating designs for most of the villains and main characters, including newcomer Giru. Early episodes are much more comedic in tone, reminiscent of early Dragon Ball. The later episodes, however, are action-packed and feature the same sort of dramatic tone that existed in Dragon Ball Z. The series ran for 64 episodes, ending after two years on the air. GT was followed by Dragon Ball Z Kai, a condensed remake of Dragon Ball Z, and Dragon Ball Super, which features a new plotline set directly after Dragon Ball Z, taking place between episodes 288 and 289 and began airing in the summer of 2015.
 Goku, Pan, and Trunks adventuring, drawn by Toriyama (Weekly Jump No.3-4, 1996) There are two companion books to the series, called the Dragon Ball GT: Perfect File, released in May 1997 and December 1997 by Shueisha's Jump Comics Selection imprint. They include series information, illustration galleries, behind-the-scenes information, and more. They were out of print for many years, but were re-released in April 2006 and this edition is still in print.
 On June 15, 2005, Toei Animation (in conjunction with distributor Pony Canyon) released the entire series (including the Gokū Jr. TV special) in an extremely limited-edition DVD boxed set (called ""Dragon Box GT""), along with a Dragon Radar remote control and an exclusive booklet. While the set features remastered audio and video, there are no subtitles, English or otherwise. It's also unavailable to the general public due to its scarce numbers and its huge cost.[6]
 Akira Toriyama credited as author in Dragon Ball GT Akira Toriyama is credited as author in the ending credits of Dragon Ball GT; he oversaw the series' production; this was the same process that was used during the production of the anime series Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. He came up with the name of the series, drew a rough design for the GT logo, he designed the GT appearance of the series main cast, and he designed the appearances of Giru and the Grand Tour Spaceship used in the Black Star Dragon Ball Saga.[7] He also drew at least three color pictures of Goku, Pan, and Trunks adventuring on various planets (Monmaasu, Rudeeze, and an area in Hell).[8]
 Super Saiyan 4 Goku, drawn by Akira Toriyama Toriyama seems to have positive feelings towards his work's continuation. He refers to his fellow GT staff as ""excellent"", praising in particular the series animator, ""animator Nakatsuru-kun is amazingly skilled, and mastered the peculiarities of my drawings"". Toriyama has said that watching GT makes him happy, and that he enjoys it.[9] Toriyama drew a promotional version of Super Saiyan 4 Goku exclusively for the Dragon Box GT. Characters and events from GT have also been included in recent Dragon Ball video games.
 Some fans do not consider GT to be an official installment of the series, most often citing that the series was not directly adapted from a Toriyama manga. Like Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, GT contains minor elements inconsistent with prior anime events. However, GT has the fewest inconsistencies of the first three anime series, making it difficult to burden the few that exist as a reason for the series to be set aside as unofficial.
 On the same Dragon Box that Toriyama illustrated the Super Saiyan 4 form, he refers to the series as ""a grand side-story of the original Dragon Ball"".[9] This controversial statement is interpreted by some fans to mean that the series is considered by Toriyama as an official continuation of his manga, and by others to mean the opposite. In December 2014, Funimation English voice actor and voice director Christopher Sabat said that GT is ""not even canon anymore"",[10] likely meaning that the release of Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods superseded GT as official content, in Sabat's opinion. Notably, Sabat's statement is one of very few recorded usages of the word ""canon"" by anyone involved in the production of any Dragon Ball media.
 Funimation's GT logo. It is identical to the original logo used in the original Japanese dub and the Blue Water English dub, but with few minor details added. This logo was unveiled in the spring of 2003. The English adaptation of Dragon Ball GT ran on Cartoon Network between November 7, 2003 and April 16, 2005, but the version by FUNimation had a major alteration: the first 16 episodes of the series, the ""Black Star Dragon Ball Saga"", were cut and replaced by a single US-only episode which summarized the episodes; this became the new series premiere and the rest of the episodes began with episode 17. This edit was implemented by the producers of the English dub to prevent viewers from possibly being put-off by these differently-toned early episodes. The 16 missing episodes have since been released as the ""Lost Episodes"".[11] When first aired, Funimation recorded a new musical score composed by Mark Menza and the openings and closings were replaced with something completely different from the original. For example, a rap was used for the opening and used different clips from the show to make up the visuals. However, when FUNimation released the series to two remastered boxed sets in 2008, the original Japanese music was restored, and English versions of the opening and all four closings were created, which are all very close to the original versions. From early 2012 until January 2015, the FUNimation version, including the ""lost episodes"", was shown on Nicktoons.
 Outside of the United States, (excluding Australia and New Zealand) a different English dub of the series was aired, featuring the voice actor of Canadian voice acting group Blue Water Studios. While the voices are different from both the American and international English dubs of Dragon Ball Z, the original background music by Akihito Tokunaga was kept, the episodes were aired in their proper order, and the scripts were kept much closer to the original Japanese version. However, the international version kept the original Japanese theme song but used English subtitles. An English version of the GT theme song was sung while this dub aired on Toonami in the UK, however these were different lyrics to the original song and not a direct translation.
 In 2008 FUNimation began production of remastering the entire Dragon Ball GT series similar to the remastering process of Dragon Ball Z. Unlike the Dragon Ball Z remastered sets, the Dragon Ball GT Remastered Season Sets are presented in a 4:3 full frame and come with 5 discs rather than 6. The GT Sets are not presented in high definition. Just like the Dragon Ball Z remastered sets, the GT Sets include English dialogue with original Japanese background music, 5.1 surround sound, English dialogue with US broadcast stereo and original Japanese mono. Both Dragon Ball GT Season Box sets include a booklet including character profiles"" and an episode guide.
 Dragon Ball GT: Season One was released on December 9, 2008. The box set includes the Black Star Dragon Ball Saga and most of the Baby Saga, spanning the first 34 episodes over 5 discs.
 Dragon Ball GT: Season Two was released on February 10, 2009. The box set includes the last six episode of the Baby Saga, Super 17 Saga and Shadow Dragon Saga, spanning the final 30 episodes concluding the series. The TV special Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy is included as part of the Box set.
 On September 21, 2010 FUNimation released Dragon Ball GT: The Complete Series which featured all 64 episodes of the show and Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy.
 Dragon Ball GT anime manga full color edition The ""Anime Comics"" manga version of Dragon Ball GT began in the January 2014 issue of Saikyō Jump, starting with the Evil Dragons Arc. Because the original story comes from an anime rather than a manga, this media is sometimes referred to as an animanga, a portmanteau of ""anime"" and ""manga"".
 Presented in full color (as opposed to the limited-color version from serialization), Shueisha released the first three volumes of Dragon Ball GT in December 4, 2019, with pricing for ¥1,000 each (plus tax), and covered the entirety of the series' Evil Dragons arc. Previously, the Dragon Ball GT anime comic was exclusive to its Saikyō Jump serialization.
 Due to series burnout, Dragon Ball GT never reached the same level of success as Dragon Ball Z in Japan (managing to get up to only 14% ratings compared to Dragon Ball Zs peak of 25% and dip to 13.5%). However in America Dragon Ball GT DVDs outsold Dragon Ball Z ones in 2003.[12]

 Dragon Ball Super (ドラゴンボール超, Doragon Bōru Sūpā) (commonly abbreviated as DBS) is the fourth anime installment in the Dragon Ball franchise, which ran from July 5th, 2015 to March 25th, 2018.[1][2] It is set between Dragon Ball Z episodes 288 and 289 and is the first Dragon Ball television series featuring a new storyline in 18 years since the final episode of Dragon Ball GT in 1997.
 A Dragon Ball Super manga was being produced alongside the anime. The series is developed by Toei, in a similar process to the Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT animes and Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods and Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’ films. The series plot takes place after the Kid Buu Saga, in between the ten-year gap towards the 28th World Martial Arts Tournament.
  Dragon Ball Super began airing in Japan on Fuji TV, July 5, 2015.[3] Akira Toriyama alongside Toyotaro handle a manga adaptation released in V-Jump monthly.[4] Kazuya Yoshii performs the opening theme, ""Chōzetsu ☆ Dynamic!!"" and the Japanese band Good Morning America (who performed Dragon Ball Kai's ending theme, Dear Zarathustra), performs the ending theme, ""Hello Hello Hello"".[5][6][7]
  Dragon Ball Super's first Japanese set was released December 2, 2015, having a DVD and Blu-ray set consisting of 12 episodes, with two discs each. The second set of Dragon Ball Super was released on March 2, 2016. The third DVD and Blu-ray set of Dragon Ball Super became available on July 2, 2016, ranging from episodes 25 to 36. The DVD sets are 12,096 yen, and the Blu-ray sets 16,416 yen. On September 24, 2016, Dragon Ball Super started airing in Portugal on SIC.[8] On October 20, 2016, building upon their more than 20-year association with the Dragon Ball franchise, Funimation and Toei Animation expanded their partnership and their multi-year agreement that would introduce “Dragon Ball Super” throughout the USA & Canada. In addition, the partnership also covered broadcast and merchandising opportunities for Dragon Ball Super as well. All subtitled episodes of Dragon Ball Super were released on FunimationNow followed by new simulcast episodes. In conjunction with the agreement, production began on an English dub of the “Dragon Ball Super” series. It was announced on December 7, 2016 that the English dub of Super would premiere on Adult Swim's Toonami block on January 7, 2017 at 8pm (7pm central) ET outside the block with a rerun of the episode at 11:30pm (8pm central) ET on the block.[9] On August 22, 2017, Dragon Ball Super started airing in Brazil on Cartoon Network Brazil. In Australia, ABC Me started airing Dragon Ball Super on November 3, 2018 with each episode coming out every Saturday at 2:45 pm. In the United Kingdom, the series aired on Pop from July 1, 2019, with episodes first airing at 7pm on weekdays.
  
The series' plot begins showing the aftermath of the Majin Buu Saga, then proceeds to retell and alter the stories of Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods and Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’ as new story arcs. The next part of Super following this takes place in the Universe 6 with the Dragon Team searching for the Super Dragon Balls.
  Akira Toriyama writes the plot outline, and then a team of writers creates the script, expanding, adding, and changing elements from Toriyama's plan as they deem appropriate.[10] They also sometimes decide not to include things from Toriyama's outline (such as Goku Black's Super Saiyan form and Fused Zamasu defusing due to the Potara's time limit).[11][12] The original suggestions for some of the storylines come from the editorial office, then Toriyama writes the outlines.[13] However, Toriyama has seemingly complained about the anime's quality at points.[14]
 As the series has progressed Toyotarō has been given more control over the state of Dragon Ball Super, making some additions to the plot overview which have been implemented into both the manga and the anime, such as the appearance of Vegito in the ""Future"" Trunks Saga,[12] and the designs of some of the Gods of Destruction.
 According to Toshio Yoshitaka, an episode takes about 3 weeks to make.[15]
 The original animation for episode five (left) was widely criticized by viewers and was redrawn for Blu-ray and DVD release (right). However, the 5th episode received harsh criticism from Japanese and Western audiences due to its poor animation style compared to the previous four episodes. These problems continued at episode 24, and several more episodes onward, until episode 39. Dragon Ball Z Kai and Resurrection 'F' producer Norihiro Hayashida felt that the criticism was overblown. He said that people were criticizing the entire series based on a few bad sequences that were done by new animators. He went on to explain a quality decline in the anime industry that he believes is the result of studios cutting time given for post-production and not allowing for reviews of the final product. These scenes were later redrawn for the DVD and Blu-ray releases.
 In a peaceful period following the defeat of Kid Buu, Goku continues to attempt to maintain Earth's peace despite being forced by Chi-Chi to get a job as a radish farmer. Gohan and Videl are married while Krillin has become a police officer.[16] The God of Destruction Beerus prophesizes of a Super Saiyan God and upon waking begins a search for the figure. The search leads him to King Kai's planet where he outclasses a Super Saiyan 3 Goku, before turning his eyes to Vegeta on Earth. Beerus enjoyed his time on Earth until he was angered by the ungenerous Majin Buu for not sharing his pudding. The Z Fighters team up to take out Beerus but his power was too much for them.
 Before Beerus could destroy the Earth, Goku intervenes and requests for more time to seek out the Super Saiyan God. Goku uses the Dragon Balls to summon Shenron and learns that a ritual is performed to make the Super Saiyan God. After achieving this state, Goku begins another battle with Beerus. In the end result of Beerus winning, Beerus leaves to go back to his planet and sleep. Sorbet and the rest of the Third Stellar Region are failing to find Dragons Balls and their empire starts to crumble by the day so they set out to revive Frieza. After Frieza has been revived, he seeks revenge on Goku and trains for four months. During this time, Goku and Vegeta are being trained by Whis to grow stronger in their base, and Videl gives birth to her and Gohan's daughter, Pan.
 Frieza has returned to Earth and brings an army of one thousand soldiers. His army has been defeated by some Z-Fighters. Goku and Vegeta eventually realize Frieza is alive and reach Earth. Goku and Vegeta combat Frieza in his Golden form using Super Saiyan Blue. Frieza destroys the Earth as a last ditch effort to escape the wrath of Vegeta, however, Whis, Beerus, Goku and some few others survive. Whis alters time and sends Goku three minutes into the past to finish off Frieza before he can destroy the Earth. Gohan starts training with Piccolo to get back in fighting shape and protect his loved ones. Additionally, Goku and Vegeta resume their training.
 Goku and Vegeta's training is interrupted once again with the arrival of Champa and Vados. It is revealed that there are twelve universes in all, and Goku and Vegeta are from Universe Seven, and Champa is the God of Destruction of Universe 6. Upon being stunned by the delicacies of Earth, Champa and Beerus arranges a Tournament of Destroyers. If Champa wins, he will swap the Earth of Universe 7 with the extinct Earth of his universe. If Beerus wins, he will obtain the six Super Dragon Balls Champa has been secretly collecting throughout the two universes. Team Universe 7, consisting of Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo, Majin Buu and the mysterious Monaka face off against Team Universe 6, Frost, Hit, Botamo, Cabba and Auta Magetta. Team Universe 7 wins after Goku surrenders in his final match with Hit, stating that he wants to fight him in full power, prompting Hit to intentionally eliminate himself against the shockingly useless Monaka in the final match. As Champa is about to incur his wrath against his own tournament candidates, Zeno, the King of All Gods, appears and says that he has been observing the event, and hopes to set up a similar tournament, with contestants from all twelve universes. Zeno leaves, and Beerus utilizes the Super Dragon Balls to resurrect Universe 6's planet Earth along with its inhabitants.
 After that event, Goku, Vegeta, Goten, Trunks and Monaka are stranded on an outer space adventure, where Goku faces off against Duplicate Vegeta. Some time later, Future Trunks uses his time machine to escape from his dystopian timeline, where Future Bulma and millions have perished from the mysterious threat known as Goku Black, a mysterious but sinister doppelganger of Goku. Arriving in the present, Trunks reunites with the Z Fighters and meets Beerus and Whis. Goku Black invades their timeline to seek Future Trunks, and ends up fighting with Goku. However, a distortion pulls him back to Future Trunks' timeline. Realizing that Black was using a mystical artifact known as the Time Ring, which only belongs to the Supreme Kais, along with Goku, Beerus & Whis travel to Universe 10, to apprehend Gowasu, who has the Time Ring, and his apprentice Zamasu, who possesses identical ki to Black. Zamasu despises all mortals due to their aggressive nature and their inevitable drive to start conflict and wars, which he believes is something that can never be prevented as long as they aren't destroyed. After he is easily defeated by Goku, Zamasu becomes fanatically obsessed with the Universe 7's imprudent warrior, who he realizes, has divine ki, which makes him believe that the power of the mortals are going unchecked.
 Zeno summons Goku to his palace, where they meet Grand Minister. Zeno declares that he wants to be Goku's friend and gives him a button that will summon him if needed. Using another time machine, Goku, Vegeta and Future Trunks head into the future and are shocked to see Black with another counterpart of Zamasu. They get defeated and head back to the past. Zamasu's beliefs of mortal extinction is strengthened after he sees more barbaric violence initiated by the mortals in the far future and later the Destroyer's Tournament, which makes him infuriated at the irresponsibility of the other gods, who he believes is not taking their job seriously. He confronts Zuno and forces him to tell him everything about the Super Dragon Balls and Goku. Shin informs of this event to the Z Fighters. Beerus, Goku, Whis & Supreme Kai head to Universe 10 where they witness Zamasu assassinating Gowasu in order to steal the Time Ring. Whis uses his Temporal Do-Over to undo the effect, and Beerus destroys Zamasu. Goku, Vegeta & Future Trunks head back to the future where they see that Goku Black and Zamasu are still present. Black reveals that he is indeed Zamasu. Before Future Trunks created a new timeline by going to the past, in the original timeline, Zamasu still met Goku, assassinated Gowasu, stole his Time Ring, and used the Super Dragon Balls to swap bodies with Goku whose power he lusts over and later kills him and his family. Realizing his own timeline is doomed beyond repair, he uses the Ring to travel to the timeline of Future Trunks and seeks a new ally, this timeline's version of Zamasu. They wreak havoc on multiple planets and universes, killing all gods, and reach to Earth as their final act of genocide, after every other part of the cosmos are wiped out, continuing their Zero Mortals Plan. Also, it is revealed that Future Zamasu used the now-destroyed Super Dragon Balls of their timeline to attain immortality.
 Trunks attains a powerful transformation, while a beaten Goku and Vegeta return to the past. Goku learns the Evil Containment Wave so that he can seal Zamasu away while Vegeta trains in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. They return to the future and later, Gowasu and Supreme Kai joins in to stop the evil acts. After Future Zamasu is driven to a corner, Goku Black decides to utilize their contingency plan, and they fuse to become Fused Zamasu. Goku and Vegeta use Supreme Kai's Potara earrings to fuse and become Vegito, and a ferocious battle ensues. However, because of the time limit and physical constraints caused by the Potara Fusion, Goku and Vegeta defuse.
 Future Trunks steps in as Zamasu is being overwhelmed by the imbalance of his spiritual and physical state and uses the energy of Goku, Vegeta and all the living beings in the planet, to slice Zamasu up, he is forced to cast off his physical body. He transcends his physical vessel and his essence & will becomes one with the very cosmos itself. Goku uses Zeno's button which summons Future Zeno, who erases the timeline out of annoyance. The surviving fighters escape to the past. Future Trunks and Goku return to the timeline back again, and they take Future Zeno to the main timeline's Zeno, and they become playmates. A traumatized and devastated Future Trunks and Future Mai decide to live in the new alternate timeline that Whis created after he went to warn Future Beerus about Zamasu and they bid a heartful final farewell to the Z Fighters after they are unable to save their own world.
 After that event, minor events revolve around some of the characters. Some time later, at Goku's request, the two Zeno's decide to organize a tournament including all twelve universes, called the Tournament of Power, which will take place in the Null Realm. In the Zeno Expo, Great Priest reveals that this tournament is not only made for recreational purposes, in fact, the Zeno's were planning to get rid of the weaker universes all along and this tournament will also serve as a judging basis for them to do so, with the four universes that were at the top of Zeno's mortal level scale, being spared automatically.
 However, before the actual Tournament begins, Future Zeno wishes to see an exhibition match to experience the thrill beforehand. The Grand Priest accedes and a warm up tournament is setup between Universe 7 and Universe 9. Majin Buu, Gohan and Goku respectively defeat the wolfish fighters Basil, Lavender, and Bergamo with Goku revealing his Super Saiyan Blue form, thus surprising all the Gods of Destruction. After Goku wins, a mysterious fighter by the name of Top wishes to fight Goku, considering himself a servant of justice and the latter as evil. An intense battle begins with Toppo dislocating Goku's shoulder and Super Saiyan Blue Goku delivering a Kamehameha at point blank range. Toppo survives but the Great Priest stops the battles before one of them dies before the tournament. Before leaving, Toppo reveals that he is not the strongest fighter in Universe 11 but it is his friend Jiren, who will destroy Goku for sure. The Great Priest announces that the tournament will begin in 40 Earth hours and all the Universes depart. Goku returns to Earth and, along with Gohan, sets out to recruit 8 other members. Vegeta agrees to participate after Bulma gives birth to their daughter, Bulla. Goku recruits Piccolo, Master Roshi, Androids 17 and 18, Tien, and Krillin. Majin Buu is selected but falls asleep and Goku chooses Frieza as a replacement, much to everyone's horror. Everyone arrives at the World of Void for the tournament and a chaotic battle royal ensues between all the eight universes.
 Powerful new warriors prove their worth in the battlefield and Universe 7 defeats Universes 9, which is promptly erased. The tournament proceeds, and Universe 6's Saiyan warriors Kale and Caulifla continue to break their limits throughout the battle royal. Shortly, Universe 10 is erased after their last fighter Obni is defeated by Gohan. As half of the time goes by in the tournament, Goku faces off against the mightiest mortal, Jiren, whose power is rumored to be in the domain of the Gods of Destruction. During his intense battle with Jiren, Goku falls after his plan to release the Spirit Bomb, but he ends up obtaining a godly state known as Ultra Instinct, which allows him to dodge any attack without having to think, in exchange of putting unconditional faith on his own body. Goku ultimately loses and proceeds to battle the other universes. Universe 6's strongest fighter Hit is unpredictably eliminated by Jiren. Goku defeats Kefla, the fusion of Kale and Caulifla, by reactivating his Ultra Instinct and erupting a mighty Kamehameha at her, throwing her out of the ring. Promptly, Universe 2 and their love warriors and Universe 6 and their last Namekian fighters are erased by the combined efforts of Universe 7, who also clear up Universe 4 and it's fighting team, comprised of cunning superpowered extraterrestrials of diverse races, briefly.
 Universe 3's mightiest warriors fuse together to create the towering and gigantic winged monster, Agnilasa, who is defeated by the combined powers of the seventh universe, causing Universe 3 to get erased. The final warriors remaining in the stage are Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Frieza and 17, who have to face off against Universe 11's Jiren, Toppo & Dyspo. Gohan eliminates himself in the process to take down Dyspo with him with the help of Frieza. Toppo, infuriated at his inability to stand a chance against Universe 7, leaves behind all his ideals and motivations to turn into a God of Destruction. Frieza is pummeled by Toppo, who is eliminated in a frenzied attack by Vegeta. Jiren finally decides to release his true power, and starts to drop his calm and composed attitude. It is revealed that Jiren's family and allies were all ravaged by an evildoer in the past, and that Jiren has lost all his faith in humanity and friendship or trust after his own allies betrayed him when they abandoned him out of fear of getting the same fate as their fallen friends. Jiren's mind broke, and so did his will. Traumatized, Jiren convinced himself that strength was absolute, that strength forgives all, even the past, as the strength of the evildoer was enough to destroy the hopes of Jiren and his allies. Jiren trained endlessly all these years, reveling in his own unstoppable growing strength to suppress his frustrations and enforcing his own brand of justice against evil by enlisting in the Pride Troopers, vowing to never let anything like his past ever happen in the future again.
 Vegeta goes beyond Super Saiyan Blue during his ferocious battle with Jiren, the last remaining Universe 11 warrior. Android 17 seemingly blows himself up in a last ditch effort to save Goku and Vegeta from Jiren. Vegeta is knocked out by Jiren, who gives all of his energy away to Goku, putting his trust in his fellow Saiyan. Goku taps into Ultra Instinct again, and goes toe to toe with Jiren, and finally, he masters the godly form. Goku proceeds to defeat Jiren, who starts going through a mental breakdown, devastated that all of his years of training and his ideals were all shattered by Goku, who proved that friendship and unity could be used as a drive to victory. Before he is able to eliminate Jiren who has started to acknowledge the Saiyan warrior's words, Goku's body suffers from using Ultra Instinct repetitively and he collapses. However, it is revealed that both Frieza and Android 17, who has survived his explosion, are still in the ring.
 They save Goku and proceed to fight a heavily damaged Jiren, who finally exhibits catharsis, upon hearing the inspiring words of his comrade Toppo who says that he believed in Jiren all along and always will. Although, initially, Frieza planned to clear up the strong enemies and then later betray Universe 7 to steal the Super Dragon Balls for himself and use it's power to turn the gods against each other and receive unimaginable strength, he realizes that Jiren's power is too much for even him to handle. Frieza reluctantly accepts to team up with Goku to save Universe 7, throwing away his selfish goals of obtaining the Super Dragon Balls to defeat their opponent in the face of erasure. Putting their complete trust in each other despite being enemies, Goku and Frieza unite their strength to eliminate Jiren. However, they are eliminated in the process. Universe 11 is erased and Android 17, the last person standing in the tournament, uses the Super Dragon Balls to restore all the erased universes. The Grand Minister reveals that Zeno foresaw the outcome of the tournament, and that if the victor used the Super Dragon Balls for a selfish wish, he would destroy everything in existence. The tournament would serve as a great message to gods of the different universes to balance the order of their own respective universes.
 Out of gratitude, Beerus commands Whis to resurrect Frieza for his true comradeship in the end. Jiren finally acknowledges that he is done letting the past bind him in the future, revealing that he has let go of his hollow exterior to mask his problems, and that he was going to face them head on. He seems to come closer to accepting the Pride Troopers as his friends. The Dragon Team return to Earth and celebrate. Bulma gifts Android 17 a cruiser for his valiant contributions in the tournament. After his imminent return, Frieza seizes the opportunity to reassemble the extinct Frieza Forces, declaring with a malicious grin, that the emperor of the universe has returned.
 Goku and Vegeta go to the place where they first battled. Goku reveals that he has lost the ability to use Ultra Instinct, but he and Vegeta promise each other that they will keep getting stronger, and continue breaking their limits.
 All the Japanese and Funimation DVD and Blu-ray releases are presented in the original 16:9 aspect ratio.

 Dragon Ball Z (ドラゴンボールＺ,  Doragon Bōru Zetto, commonly abbreviated as DBZ) is the long-running sequel to the anime Dragon Ball. The series is a close adaptation of the second (and far longer) portion of the Dragon Ball manga written and drawn by Akira Toriyama. In the United States, the manga's second portion is also titled Dragon Ball Z to prevent confusion for younger readers.
 Dragon Ball Z opening title card in the original Japanese version Dragon Ball Z follows the adventures of the adult Goku who, along with his companions, defends the earth against an assortment of villains ranging from intergalactic space fighters and conquerors, unnaturally powerful androids and near indestructible magical creatures. While the original Dragon Ball anime followed Goku through childhood into adulthood, Dragon Ball Z is a continuation of his adulthood life, but at the same time parallels the maturation of his son, Gohan, as well as other characters from Dragon Ball and more. The separation between the series is also significant as the latter series takes on a more dramatic and serious tone. The anime also features characters, situations and back-stories not present in the original manga.
 The main characters of Dragon Ball Z The other names the production was considering for this second series before they settled on Dragon Ball Z were Dragon Ball: Gohan's Big Adventure, New Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball 2, Dragon Ball Wonder Boy, and Dragon Ball 90.[1] The anime first premiered in Japan on April 26, 1989 (on Fuji TV) at 7:30 p.m. and ended on January 31, 1996. The series average rating was 20.5%, with its maximum being 27.5% (Episode 218) and its minimum being 12.1% (Episode 273). Like Dragon Ball, the music for Dragon Ball Z was composed by Shunsuke Kikuchi. The character designs for Dragon Ball Z were created by Minoru Maeda from the Raditz Saga to the Cell Games Saga and Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru from the Great Saiyaman Saga to the Peaceful World Saga.
 Toriyama's humor/parody manga Nekomajin, released after Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, features several concepts introduced in the series, and several Dragon Ball Z characters make various appearances in this manga. After Dragon Ball Z, the story of Goku and friends continues in the anime-only series Dragon Ball GT, which is not based on a manga by Akira Toriyama but is a project by Toei Animation using the same characters and storyline that serves as a sequel to Dragon Ball Z. 19 years after the end of Dragon Ball Z in Japan, a new sequel series titled Dragon Ball Super premiered with original concepts by Akira Toriyama, taking place after the death of Kid Buu but before Dragon Ball Z's ending.
 In the U.S., the series initially aired in first-run syndication from September 13, 1996, to May 23, 1998, and then aired on Cartoon Network's Toonami block from August 31, 1998, to April 7, 2003, though not always with the same continuity of dubbing (for details on the dubbing problems, see Ocean Group dubs and Funimation dub). It was also shown in Canada on YTV around the same time. It aired in the UK, with the same dubbing problem, on Cartoon Network, premiering on March 6, 2000 and running on that channel until 2002. The Majin Buu Saga, Fusion Saga and Kid Buu Saga were later broadcast on CNX, which later changed its name to Toonami, with the show ending on February 28, 2003. After the finished run, it was repeated daily, until Toonami merged with Cartoon Network. In Australia it was shown on both Cartoon Network and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation with Cartoon Network airing it in around 1997-1999 and ABC from 1999-2004. In New Zealand, it was shown on TV3.
 In April 2009, a new 'refresh' of Dragon Ball Z began airing on Japanese television. This re-cut is titled Dragon Ball Z Kai.
 Dragon Ball Z was marketed to appeal to a wide range of viewers from all ages, and contains crude humor and occasional excesses of violence which are commonly seen as inappropriate for younger audiences by American standards. When it was first marketed in the US, the distribution company Funimation alongside Saban decided to initially focus exclusively on the young children's market, because the anime market was still small compared to the much larger children's cartoon market. This censorship often had unintentionally humorous results, such as changing all references to death so the dead characters were merely going to ""another dimension"", and digitally altering two ogres' shirts to read ""HFIL"" instead of ""HELL"".
 Starting with the Captain Ginyu Saga on Cartoon Network, censorship was reduced due to fewer restrictions on cable programming. Funimation did the dubbing on their own this time around with their voice actors. In 2004, Funimation began to redub the first two sagas of Dragon Ball Z, to remove the problems that were caused by their previous partnership with Saban. They also redubbed the first three movies.
 However, the show still retained some level of censorship, not out of FCC laws, but out of choice by Funimation, to cater to the possible sensitivity of western audiences. For example, Mr. Satan was renamed ""Hercule"" to avoid any religious slurs; his daughter, Videl, was a play on the word ""Devil"", but Funimation felt that the connection was obscure enough to not worry about.
 Main article: Filler
Filler is used to pad out the series for many reasons; in the case of Dragon Ball Z, more often than not, it was because the anime was running alongside the manga, and there was no way for the anime to run ahead of the manga (since Toriyama was still writing it, at the same time).
 Some of the series' main heroes and villains The company behind the anime, Toei Animation, would occasionally make up their own side stories to either further explain things, or simply to extend the series. Filler does not come only in the form of side stories, though; sometimes it is as simple as adding some extra attacks into a fight. One of the more infamous examples of filler is the Frieza Saga. After Frieza had set the planet Namek to blow up in five minutes, the final fight between Goku and Frieza still lasted well over five episodes, much less five minutes, although this can be attributed to the fact that Namek simply took longer to explode than Frieza expected. Also, many numerous filler scenes took place while the battle with Frieza was in motion, which accounts for much of the footage during the planet's explosion.
 As the anime series was forced to expand 12 pages of manga text into 25 minutes of animation footage, these changes were introduced to kill time or to allow the (anime) writers to explore some other aspect of the series' universe. The Garlic Jr. Saga (Garlic Jr.'s return from the Dragon Ball Z: Dead Zone movie) between the Frieza Saga and Trunks Saga and the Other World Tournament between the Cell Games Saga and the Majin Buu Saga are both good examples of this.
 Besides having filler scenes and episodes, there are many other changes from the original manga. Among them are the following:
 The impact of Dragon Ball Z is enormous. For more than 20 years, the series has stood the test of time and has reached out to many children and adults alike across the globe. This is mainly due to the series' very clear representations of good overpowering evil, love overpowering hate, the importance of family and friends, and an unyielding passion toward achieving goals. The series also featured heavy sci-fi overtones, and a greater emphasis on fighting - making it extremely popular among adolescent boys who had grown up alongside the original series.
 Dragon Ball Z - along with Sailor Moon and Pokémon - has also played a large part in contributing to the popularity of anime in western culture. Though the first two seasons of the series were played on various networks in the U.S. in 1996, it would not take off for two more years until August 31, 1998, when Cartoon Network featured the show in its action-oriented Toonami lineup. Toonami heralded the show as ""The Greatest Action Cartoon Ever Made,"" and it greatly boosted the popularity of Toonami, but unknowingly did so much more. Dragon Ball Z's newfound popularity helped to bring about a greater interest in Japanese cartoons in the eyes of western youth, which in turn fueled the western anime industry to new heights. Because of its success on Toonami, Dragon Ball Z was the first anime that made its way to the Wall Street Journal, who declared it ""A Huge Cartoon Hit.""
 Many items such as apparel, backpacks, lunch boxes, writing utensils, candies, drinks, foods and more feature Dragon Ball Z, in both Japan and North America. Action figures, collectible figurines, plush toys, bobbleheads, and character model kits were also made. The fast-food chain Burger King featured Dragon Ball Z toys twice in the early 2000s. Despite the TV series officially ending in Japan in 1996, and in 2003 in North America, Dragon Ball Z video games are created nearly every year for almost every console on the market, helping to introduce the Dragon Ball Z series to younger generations that never got a chance to see it air on television. These games usually do very well in the market. Popular sites such as YouTube have attracted large Dragon Ball Z fan communities throughout the last few years, and Dragon Ball related videos receive many views. All of these examples showcase the incredible popularity of Dragon Ball Z in many countries of the world.
 The original author of the manga, Akira Toriyama, held a great deal of respect for both the Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z anime and those that developed them. Toriyama also admired the fact that the anime managed to possess original stories created by the animation team and stated that he considered the Dragon Ball anime to be equal in importance to the Dragon Ball manga.[2]
 Originally, only the Dragon Ball Z movies and the Plan to Eradicate the Saiyans OVA were available for home viewing in Japan. The movies were released on both VHS and Laserdisc format. The Plan to Eradicate the Saiyans OVA was released both on VHS and the PlayDia, as an interactive FMV.
 Main article: Dragon Box In 2003, all of the Dragon Ball Z TV series was finally released under the ""Dragon Box"" label for home viewing in Japan, on two large DVD boxed sets, following the release of a similar set for Dragon Ball. Each Dragon Ball Z Dragon Box had a large number of DVD extras, as well as an action figure and a book.
 The video and audio transfers of the show used on these DVDs came off of the Fuji TV master tapes of the show, as this allowed Toei to put out a far superior and completely accurate version of the show on DVD, which was helpful since the entire plot of a season could be summed up in about ten minutes. This allowed all episodes to have their original openings, endings, eyecatches, next episode previews, etc., compared to what was available in the US.
 In late 2005 the Dragon Box Z DVDs were re-released in single volumes with six episodes per disc. While the packaging and DVD menus are different from the 2003 release, and so far no plans have been announced for the two TV specials and the Playdia footage released with the 2003 versions, the Audio and Visual quality is the same as those discs found in the 2003 Dragon Box release.
 On April 14, 2006, a ""Dragon Box: The Movies"" DVD box was released. This release contained all 17 Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z theatrical features, containing 8 DVDs in total, along with a book, and two scouters in the form of walkie-talkies. The video and audio are remastered; however, the video is cropped to 16:9 (widescreen) and contains less picture than the full-screen versions. This is a common occurrence for films from Toei based on long-running and popular TV series (See Saint Seiya, Fist of the North Star, and One Piece).
 All Dragon Box releases contain Japanese language audio only (with exceptions to foreign-language bonus clips), and no subtitles.
 DVD Boxed Set I; The Saiyan Conflict  During the late 90's/the early '00s, the first 53 (Saban/Funimation version numbers, originally uncut as 67) TV episodes were released on to DVD by Pioneer Entertainment (now NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan). These contained only the edited, US-TV broadcast versions (dubbed by the Ocean Group), and totaled 17 volumes, comprising the 'Saiyan Saga' and the 'Namek Saga'.
 Along with these episodes, Pioneer also produced bilingual, uncut DVDs of the first three Dragon Ball Z theatrical features. These DVDs retained the original Ocean cast for the English track, as well as being one of the first uncut and bilingual releases in the U.S. The English versions of these films were also subject to a different treatment than the series; rather than replacing the original music, the original OP and ED themes, as well as background music, were retained. The only noticeable differences besides languages are the inclusion of a few different sound effects which are not present on the original Japanese version. These films were released as a three-disc boxset by Pioneer.
 As of August the 31st, 2004, Pioneer's license for video distribution of the first 53 episodes ended, allowing Funimation to re-release them. At the moment, the rights for these episodes and the first three Dragon Ball Z movies belong to Funimation.
 Funimation's Captain Ginyu Saga DVDs  As of 2000, Funimation had released uncut versions of their Texas-based English dub on to DVD, with Japanese language track, and English-translation subtitles. This release does not include the first two sagas, as the rights for the distribution of that episodes were still held by Pioneer Entertainment. These DVDs begin with the Captain Ginyu Saga and contain every episode covering (Japanese numbers) 68 till 291. Boxsets were release for the Garlic Jr., Androids, Imperfect Cell, Perfect Cell, World Tournament, Majin Buu, Fusion, and Kid Buu U.S. sagas. However, to maximize profits, the DVDs were released out of continuity (certain amounts of one section of the series were released, and then Funimation would go back and release others). With no noticeable numbering visible, this caused frustration to those trying to follow the series from start to finish.
 Funimation also released Dragon Ball Z movies 4-13, finishing the release of the movies with Wrath of the Dragon, the 13th movie. These are all bilingual and subtitled, but do not follow the trend set by Ocean's first three movies. Music has been changed and altered, including the insertion of songs from rock bands such as Deftones, Disturbed, Breaking Point, and American Pearl. The movies utilize Funimation's TV series Texas cast, though they also include the original Japanese version with subtitling by Steve Simmons.
 Vegeta Saga I: Saiyan Showdown  After acquiring the video rights to the first 53 (67 uncut) episodes from Pioneer in 2004, Funimation announced that they would release these episodes uncut, with a new 5.1 English language track and uncut footage. The ""Ultimate Uncut Special Edition"" line was born. The release would be 22 volumes, bilingual, and extras. The Saiyan Saga was renamed the 'Vegeta' Saga (Parts I and II, covering 12 DVDs), probably to avoid confusion with the Pioneer volumes. However, after DVD volume 9, Funimation canceled these box sets and planned to re-re-release them in the DVD season boxsets. This upset fans who had purchased the expensive Ultimate Uncut DVDs, as the Vegeta Saga Part II was never completed and the Ultimate Uncut Namek Saga DVDs were not created.
 Funimation had also acquired the rights for the first three movies from Pioneer in 2004 and re-released them. Even though the three had the same cover style, only the first movie was released under the Ultimate Uncut line. All of these movies had a 5.1 English track, new subtitles, different DVD extras and come in a boxset titled 'First Strike'. However, they do not retain the original dub and contain a new English dub produced by Funimation's Texas cast. This version contains different music than the original dub and the Japanese version.
 Main article: Funimation Remastered Box Sets  Season 1  In November 2005, Funimation announced they would release a remastered form of Dragon Ball Z on DVD beginning in 2007. All DBZ episodes were to be digitally remastered and released in boxset form.
 The first season set (the entire Vegeta Saga) was re-released on February 6, 2007. The first 39 episodes of this season are spread across 6 discs and cost $30–$50 (the original intention was for 5 discs, but there was a risk of quality reduction). Funimation released a trailer for the new set on the Dragon Ball Z official website.
 Funimation released the second season set, containing both the Namek and Captain Ginyu sagas, on May 22, 2007. Beginning with this release, several of the in-house voice actors re-dubbed their characters' lines to keep consistency with the remainder of the dub. The third season set, containing the Frieza Saga, was released on September 18, 2007. The fourth season, containing both the Garlic Jr., Trunks and Android sagas, was released on February 11, 2008. Season five, containing both the Imperfect and Perfect Cell sagas, was released on May 27, 2008. Season six, containing the Cell Games Saga, was released on September 16, 2008. Season seven, containing both the Great Saiyaman and World Tournament sagas, was released on November 11, 2008. Season eight, containing both the Babidi and Majin Buu sagas, was released on February 10, 2009. Season nine, containing both the Fusion and Kid Buu sagas, was released on May 19, 2009.
 The series has been re-transferred at 1080p resolution with digital restoration technology removing all grain and scratches from Funimation's original prints of the series. It is important to note, however, that like many late 80's-early 90's Toei productions (for example, Saint Seiya, Sailor Moon, Marmalade Boy, Ghost Sweeper Mikami, and Slam Dunk), the series was produced on 16-millimeter film which tends to be fairly grainy and soft. The new restoration was supervised by colorist Steve Franko.
 The series is presented in a widescreen format (1.78:1, cropped from the original full frame) for the first time. Comparison images from the new set show that while there is missing footage on the top and bottom, there is at least additional footage on the right and left that has not appeared in any prior release, having been taken straight from the original Japanese film master recording.
 This format change was highly controversial among fans, as this is not how the T.V. episodes were intended to be seen and this substantially alters them. Many fans launched a letter-writing campaign against the release. In response to the negative fan outcry regarding the release's apparent cropping of the source video, a Funimation representative has released a document from the team remastering the video, which explains the logistics of the new release. This document details how certain areas of the original film are damaged, and admits that though the video is cropped, this release eliminates the grain that was present on prior 4:3 releases. It has also been theorized that it is ultimately more inexpensive to transfer the series in 16:9 and thereby remove the damaged portions of the frame than to repair 291 episodes' worth of damaged film.
 The boxset contains a revised English track in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound (it contains the original Japanese score by Shunsuke Kikuchi, although it is unknown just how the English dialogue is revised). For the first time, there is a choice between having the Japanese dialogue with Toei's original Japanese music or English dialogue with either Funimation's dub music or Toei's original Japanese music.
 Special features include a featurette on the remastering of the original Japanese print and a 24-page booklet with episode summaries, character descriptions and a DBZ timeline.
 Main article: Funimation Dragon Box Sets  Dragon Box 1  Funimation Dragon Box sets were confirmed for release by Funimation Entertainment on July 19, 2009. The Dragon Box was produced from the original Dragon Box masters after a frame by frame restoration and spans the entire 291 episodes of Dragon Ball Z.
 This definitive DVD box release begins with Dragon Box One which includes the first 42 episodes, uncut, on 6 discs.
 The Dragon Box releases feature an aspect ratio of 4:3, the original Japanese audio (with options for an English track or English subtitles), the original episode previews, complete opening and closing credits and a collector's booklet.
 While Toei's DBZ Dragon Boxes consists of only two volumes, Funimation's divides the series into seven; Dragon Box One was released on November 10, 2009, with an SRP of $79.98, while Dragon Box Two was released on February 16, 2010, Dragon Box Three was released on May 4, 2010, Dragon Box Four was released on September 21, 2010, Dragon Box Five was released on April 26, 2011, Dragon Box Six was released on July 5, 2011, and Dragon Box Seven was released on October 11, 2011.
 Main article: Dragon Ball Z: Rock the Dragon Edition   It is the release of the original Funimation/Saban dub of Dragon Ball Z in a box set. The set consists of the 53 episodes (which were edited from the first 67 Japanese episodes of DBZ) and includes the first three Dragon Ball Z movies (Dead Zone, The World's Strongest, The Tree of Might). It was released on August 20, 2013. The collector's edition features the Ocean voice cast and opening theme song ""Rock the Dragon"". It also features a hardbound full-color 48-page book that showcases the character's history, and tropes that helped elevate DBZ to the pop culture it is today.
    In July 2011, Funimation announced plans to release Dragon Ball Z in Blu-ray format. The first volume was released on November 18, 2011. However, after the release of the second volume, Funimation discontinued production of the rest of the Blu-ray releases, citing concerns over restoring the original film material frame by frame. The episodes were presented in their original 4:3 aspect ratio.
    Funimation confirmed in June 2013 that the Blu-ray season box sets of DBZ would take place once again. The first set, ""Dragon Ball Z Season 1"", was released on December 31, 2013, and the final set, ""Dragon Ball Z Season 9"", was released on December 9, 2014. The episodes are presented in the cropped 16:9 widescreen format. However, unlike the ""Orange Brick"" DVD sets which were a ""straight crop"", these use pan and scan so that important information in the frame is not lost.
    On March 2, 2019, Funimation announced that Dragon Ball Z will be celebrating its 30th Anniversary with a Collector's Edition Blu-ray compiling the full series in a 4:3 aspect ratio along with some extra goods. However, they need at least 2,500 fans to reserve the set for it to be produced. They need to measure interest since it's a high-cost endeavor, and 2,500 is the minimum of interested fans needed according to Funimation. But if Funimation fails to get the 2,500 pledges to produce the Collector's Edition, they will not release the anniversary set. However, Funimation announced that they needed 3,000 pre-orders from fans and the previous 2,500 pledges was a mistake. Funimation began taking pre-orders for the set on April 6 and had since then reached the necessary 3,000 pre-orders making them eligible to produce 6,000 units of the set overall. The release of the teaser for this box set sparked many controversies among fans concerning the remastered footage’s framework, color saturation and other footage components that looked worse than previous footage from older collectors editions as fans viewed the teaser featuring the remastered clips. Funimation responded by stating that they cropped the release by going in ""scene-by-scene to make judgments based onto the image available in each frame of how much to trim to get to a consistent 4:3 aspect ratio, while still attempting to cut as little out of the picture as possible,"" and that they felt the digital video noise reduction was ""mandatory for this release based on the different levels of fan support from various past DBZ releases with different levels of noise reduction over the years."" Funimation took pre-orders for the 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition until May 5. It was released on November 5th, 2019.
  An ""anime comic"" manga adaption of the Dragon Ball Z anime was released in Japan from 2005 to 2010. The sagas covered included the ""Saiyan Saga"", ""Super Saiyan / Ginyu Special-Squad Saga"", ""Super Saiyan / Freeza Saga"", ""Artificial Humans Saga"", ""Cell Game Saga"", ""Afterlife Tournament Saga"", ""Majin Boo Revival Saga"", and ""Majin Boo Battle Saga"".
 Scott McNeil
 Dragon Ball Z peaked at 25% ratings and its lowest point was 13.5%, much better ratings than its successor Dragon Ball GT (which got up to 14%). However in America Dragon Ball GT DVDs outsold Dragon Ball Z ones in 2003.[3]

 Dragon Ball Z Kai, known in Japan as Dragon Ball Kai (ドラゴンボール改, Doragon Bōru Kai, lit. Dragon Ball Revised), is an anime series that is a high-definition remastered and recut of Dragon Ball Z, done for its 20th Anniversary. It premiered on Fuji TV on April 5, 2009, at 9:00 am just before One Piece and ended initially on March 27, 2011, with 97 episodes (a 98th episode was later released straight-to-video), and the two shows were marketed together as ""Dream 9"", which refers to the hour in which they both aired. The series average rating was 9.4%, with its maximum being 12.3% (Episode 47) and its minimum being 6.4% (Episode 18). Dragon Ball Kai returned to Japanese TV on April 6, 2014, with the Majin Buu Saga, and ended its run for the second and last time on June 28, 2015, with 61 episodes while the original uncut international version would go on to have 69 episodes (bringing the total episode count of the series to 159 for the original Japanese broadcast and 167 for the extended International broadcast).[1]
 For most of the international releases, the Majin Buu Saga of the series is known as Dragon Ball Z Kai: The Final Chapters.
 The ""Kai"" (改「かい」) in the series' name means ""updated,"" ""modified,"" or ""altered,"" reflecting it being an abridging of the original anime that removes a majority of its filler.[2] Two issues of Shonen JUMP have included some primary information about the series.[3] Interestingly, despite the series being only a director's cut of Dragon Ball Z, the Z has been completely removed from the title (at least in the original Japanese version).
 International Dragon Ball Z Kai logo Funimation has dubbed Dragon Ball Kai into English for a North American release, under the release title of Dragon Ball Z Kai (more information can be viewed below). The series premiered on the Nicktoons Network on May 24, 2010.[4] This was quite a change, as all the Dragon Ball series have almost always appeared on Cartoon Network in the United States. On August 14, 2010, the series premiered on The CW's Toonzai block.[5] The uncut version of the series began airing on Adult Swim's Toonami block on November 8, 2014.[6] It was shown on Kix in the United Kingdom.
 Dragon Ball Kai Buu Saga After episode 97, there were initially no plans for Dragon Ball Kai to reach the Majin Buu Saga. A new anime series based on the Toriko manga debuted in April 2011, taking over the Dragon Ball Kai time slot at 9 AM on Sunday mornings before the One Piece anime series. The 97th episode of the series was broadcast on March 27, 2011 in Japan, and January 1, 2012 in America. The series was in syndication in Japan for exactly two years. Despite this, the series has been one of the top 10 rated anime series every week since syndication began in April 2009. The 98th episode of the series, which recapped the entire series and provided some closure, was released to DVD/Blu-ray on August 2, 2011, in Japan and was aired on Nicktoons in the U.S. on February 8, 2013.[7][8] In November 2012, it was confirmed that the production of Dragon Ball Z Kai would continue and air outside of Japan.[9] Mayumi Tanaka (the Japanese voice of Krillin in the series) posted the news on her blog confirming that Dragon Ball Kai would be continuing, as voice work was already underway for the early stages of the Majin Buu story arc. Her post went on to specify that the series revival is for the overseas market, and as of the time of her post there are no plans to air the new episodes in Dragon Ball's home country of Japan.[9] In April 2013, Sean Schemmel and Kyle Hebert (the Funimation dub voice actors for Goku and Gohan) confirmed they were recording their lines for the Funimation dub of the Buu Saga. In November 2013, when questioned about it on their Facebook page, it was stated by Australian anime distributor Madman Entertainment that the Buu Saga of Dragon Ball Z Kai should be released on November 8, 2014 on Cartoon Network, as they were just waiting on dubs to be finished.[10]
 Dragon Ball Kai returned with the Majin Buu arc to Japanese TV on April 6, 2014, taking over the time slot previously occupied by Toriko.[1] This story arc was comprised of 61 episodes for the Japanese version, and 69 episodes for the International version, raising the total episode count for the entire Kai series to 159 episodes for the Japanese version and 167 episodes for the International version.
 Comparison of aspect ratios from Dragon Ball Z Kai (left) and Dragon Ball Z (right). Click to enlarge The series was extensively ""refreshed"" for Japanese television. This is not a new animation, but rather a remastered edit that runs through Dragon Ball Z to provide a presentation that is as faithful to the original manga as possible, removing a majority of DBZ's padding and filler. Part of this is reformatting and extending the picture to 16:9 Widescreen. However, for episodes 1-98, this only exists with the footage used for the Japanese and Nicktoons broadcasts; the footage used for the home media release and Toonami broadcasts are in the original 4:3 ratio. Through digital processing, the image was made vibrant. All the music, damage and noise remaining on the Dragon Ball Z film is removed, making the image much clearer in high-definition.
 A comparison with the original video side-by-side shows considerable cropping to achieve the 16:9 aspect ratio. However, it seems carefully done to avoid missing anything important. The original image is not stretched, just cut where it would be more appropriate, being a ""tilt and scan"" or ""reverse pan and scan"" of the original Dragon Ball Z footage.
 New ending credits with new animations of Dodoria and Zarbon (top left), the Ginyu Force (top right), Frieza (center left), Raditz (center right), and Nappa and Vegeta (bottom left), the bottom right symbol is the Kanji for ""Kai"". Dragon Ball Kai includes a complete re-recording of the dialog by most of the original Japanese voice cast (in part due to the master audio for Z being permanently lost), as well as completely new sound design with updated sound effects. The opening and ending themes are completely new. Takayoshi Tanimoto performs the series' opening themes ""Dragon Soul"" and ""Kuu-Zen-Zetsu-Go"", and the closing theme ""Yeah! Break! Care! Break!"" These new opening and closing credits have newly animated appearances by most of the main cast, as well as for the villains, such as Raditz, Nappa, Vegeta, Frieza, Zarbon, Dodoria, and the Ginyu Force. There's also a new artwork clip after every intermission, such as one of Cui and Vegeta in episode 19. Unlike the original Dragon Ball Z, which only had two sets of eyecatches for the entire series, in Dragon Ball Kai, it changes every few episodes to feature an appropriate character ensemble/situation.
 As with most filler sequences in Dragon Ball Z, the Garlic Jr. Saga does not air in Dragon Ball Kai. Originally lasting from episodes 108 to 117, the saga featured the return of Garlic Jr., the main villain from the first DBZ movie. The saga was completely filler and Garlic Jr. or any of his henchmen did not appear in the original manga. Because Kai stays truer to the manga, this saga has been completely cut out.
 Original palette Revised palette The first 98 episodes of Kai feature new digital animation, often used to rectify continuity errors in the source print. Among other things, Vegeta's red palette while on an unnamed planet in the beginning of the series has been altered to the color scheme used from his arrival on Earth-onwards; however, Nappa's armor still uses a different palette, bearing brown pauldrons and banding instead of the standard marigold. Shots of Piccolo bleeding red blood are also altered to recolor his blood purple, such as in the Dragon Ball recap of episode one or during his fight with Raditz. However, when Raditz is explaining to Goku about the Saiyans, Vegeta has his red color scheme.
 New scene: Vegeta's assault For the Androids Saga, the animation in the opening scene and closing credits have been altered a bit to fit the current storyline. New animations of Dr. Gero, Android 19, Android 17, Android 18, Android 16, and Cell appear, as well as the Super Saiyan appearances of Goku, Vegeta, Future Trunks, and Gohan. The new intro also showcases battles taking place within the saga, such as Vegeta vs. #18, Piccolo vs. #17, #16 vs. Cell, Goku vs. Cell, and ends showing a sequence of the Dragon Team standing together with their Cell Saga appearances. The ending credits are also different, showcasing Goku flying with Shenron as the faces of the main cast appear. He proceeds to transform into a Super Saiyan and the cast joins him in flight. The sequence ends with the Z Fighters standing in front of the Earth, with Shenron and Porunga in the backdrop.
 For the Majin Buu Saga, the show uses a different remaster done in-house at Toei Animation. This version is shot in cropped 16:9 rather than the original 4:3 ratio, even for the American release, and features a noticeable greenish tint compared to the Dragon Ball Z Blu-rays. Additionally, the neo-classic animation by Q-TEC that appeared throughout the previous 98 episodes is gone (due to Toei now re-mastering the footage in-house), and a new animated intro sequence for the series is used with fights and events corresponding with the Majin Buu Saga, such as Goku vs Majin Vegeta, Super Buu uses his Human Extinction Attack, Goku, Vegeta, Goten, and Trunks fusing into Vegito and Gotenks, respectively, then moves to Potential Unleashed Gohan and Gotenks vs Super Buu, and finally, Goku transforming into Super Saiyan 3 and then fighting Kid Buu, with the former launching a massive energy blast and the latter firing his Kamehameha, the sequence ends with the heroes in assembly as Super Saiyan 3 Goku drops by and powers up. This arc had five different newly animated endings, with each ending that corresponds to the arc's sagas or situations (like ""Oh Yeah!!!!!!!"" for the Fusion Saga or ""Don't Let Me Down"" for the Kid Buu and the Peaceful World Sagas.)
 Toei released the first set on DVD and Blu-ray in September 2009 in a 4:3 aspect ratio, which is said that is how it was originally created and was only 16:9 ratio before because it was cropped for HD TV.[citation needed] The refreshed series also spawned a stage play named Dragon Ball Kai: Super Battle Stage.
 Dragon Ball Kai used a new background musical score by Kenji Yamamoto, composer of the Dragon Ball video games. His score was used regularly for all releases of episodes 1-95, however, he was given a layoff notice from Toei Animation after it was discovered that he had spent nearly his entire career at Toei infringing off of works from various western artists (such as Earth, Wind and Fire, Pink Floyd, Stratovarius, Propaganda, James Horner and Danny Elfman) and eventually resigned. The last few episodes of Dragon Ball Kai, as well as Japanese reruns of past episodes, made use of music recycled from Dragon Ball Z by Shunsuke Kikuchi (although the Dragon Ball Kai theme songs remained intact), however, the placing of the music differed from the original series. It is unconfirmed if the original matching of the tracks with the scenes as the original series will ever be released.
 The American broadcast of Dragon Ball Z Kai was affected as well. The 5th American DVD/Blu-ray volume was delayed twice, due to Funimation replacing Yamamoto's score with the original Dragon Ball Z background score for the remainder of the English release of Dragon Ball Z Kai, for the DVDs/Blu-rays (all episodes) and the TV Version (all episodes). The re-released Dragon Ball Kai collections including episodes 1-26 and episodes 27-52 have included the random placement of the original tracks. It is possible, though, that Funimation has not disposed of the original masters as Toonami mistakenly aired the Yamamoto score for the first episode. Norihito Sumitomo, who composed music for the film Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods, would succeed Yamamoto for the series' music, and composed new background music for the series' Majin Buu Saga, and some of this arc's music was reused for the new series Dragon Ball Super, in which Sumitomo also composed the scores.
 ""The phenomenon that defined a generation... is back for more.""
— Funimation's tagline in the season one release trailer
 Navarre revealed during its Q3 2010 earnings conference call, on February 2, 2010, that its North American anime distributor Funimation had licensed the Dragon Ball Kai series for release in the ""latter part of the upcoming fiscal year."" However, it was re-titled Dragon Ball Z Kai. Funimation later confirmed the license with AnimeNewsNetwork.com. Dragon Ball Z Kai Part One was released to DVD and Blu-ray on May 18, 2010. The cast for Kai was mostly the same as DBZ except for a few re-casts for various reasons. The English dub for the series was produced by Okatron 5000 in Dallas, TX, US at the same recording studio used for the video games of the Dragon Ball franchise, with Christopher Sabat as one of the primary voice directors. Cartoon Network, broadcaster of all previous Dragon Ball media, passed on the rights to show Dragon Ball Z Kai (though the series would eventually air on the channel as part of Adult Swim). Instead, Kai premiered on Nicktoons in the U.S. on May 24, 2010.[4]
 A comparison of the opening scene in Dragon Ball Kai. The shot on the left is the original uncut  scene, and the right being the one that appeared on Nicktoons. It is clear to see all traces of blood have been removed from Bardock's face The series was edited on Nicktoons to fit the intended audience, and occasionally contains different verbiage than the home release, which is entirely unedited. Some character attacks regained their correct and untranslated-proper-noun announcements in the unedited dub (i.e. ""Makankōsappō"" instead of Special Beam Cannon, ""Kienzan"" instead of Destructo Disc, etc.), although some of the official English names for the attacks are retained for the broadcast version. Most other names used in the English dub remain the same (i.e. Krillin and Tien Shinhan instead of ""Kuririn"" and ""Tenshinhan""). Less liberty is taken with the script, and episode titles are mostly literal translations of their original Japanese versions. Nicktoons' broadcast originally used Kenji Yamamoto's musical score, however it changed to Shunsuke Kikkuichi's cues after the music plagiarism incident (see ""Music"" above). The opening theme was retained, although shortened to allow time for more commercials. The broadcast used Vic Mignogna's version of the theme song for the full run, even though his complete version was only used for Episodes 27 - 39 on the official home video release. The ending theme was usually cut, and the credits were shown in split screen, although a shorter version of the ending was used on occasion.
 The CW also aired Funimation's English dub of Dragon Ball Z Kai in their Toonzai block (later named Vortexx). Their broadcast contained most of the edits of the Nicktoons version, as well as extra editing to fit the stricter broadcast standards (see ""English adaptations"" below). Like Nicktoons' broadcast, the Toonzai broadcast featured the Kenji Yamamoto score before being replaced with the Shunsuke Kikuchi score.
 Main article: List of Dragon Ball Z Kai episodes
 Super Saiyan Goku Toei Animation stated that the Dragon Ball Kai episodes would be edited to more closely follow Akira Toriyama's original story in the manga, resulting in a faster moving story, and to remove any damaged frames.[11] Dragon Ball Kai minimizes the filler material produced for Dragon Ball Z's original production run. On the broadcast episodes, only a few minutes of filler material with no impact to the story have been left in (like Gregory's appearance at King Kai's Planet, who wasn't present in the manga), probably to help the episode reach its full 20 min.
 Super Saiyan 2 Gohan Happinet (the Japanese company releasing the series on DVD and Blu-ray) announced the Japanese DVD and Blu-ray release would have an end point of ""98 Episodes (tentative)"" meaning the planned and announced episode count would end at 99.[12] Actually, Dragon Ball Kai was supposed to last for 98 episodes, but everything had originally been thrown off an entire week due to the horrific tsunami that struck Japan the prior week. The series temporarily ended with 97 episodes aired, and the 98th episode was released direct-to-video. A few years later, the series returned with 61 Majin Buu Saga episodes in Japan.[1]
 Dragon Ball Z Kai, ""The Final Chapters"" logo The title screen translations are far more similar this time around, but are changed to fit properly into English. Edits were been made to the version appearing on Nicktoons; these include the removal of blood (which sometimes is replaced with black grayish liquid where the blood is supposed to be), overly violent moments, profanity and others. The CW's Toonzai airings, however, were edited even more so than the Nicktoons version, due to tighter restrictions on broadcast programming. These edits include recoloring Mr. Popo's skin from black to blue, replacing dead characters' halos with glowing orbs, removing virtually all references to death in both dialogue and episode titles, and renaming certain special techniques (i.e. Goku's Spirit Bomb renamed as the ""Spirit Blast"" and Vegeta's Galick Gun as the ""Galick Blast""). Also in the beginning of the intro song, Toonzai edited out Shenron and replaced him with a green colored sky. When Toonzai became Vortexx, these edits remained but the halos/glowing orbs were removed altogether. On Nicktoons, the series aired from May 24, 2010 to February 8, 2013; on Toonzai/Vortexx, the series aired from August 14, 2010 to September 27, 2014 when the block was cancelled.
 Dragon Ball Z Kai, ""The Final Chapters""  promotional image The series returned with the 69 Majin Buu Saga episodes in 2014 in Europe, carrying the sub-title ""The Final Chapters"". This remastered and reedited series was broadcasted in the UK on Kix, in Portugal on Sic Radical, in Poland on AXN Spin, and in France on Game One. On May 25, 2014, Funimation and Adult Swim announced that the English dub of Dragon Ball Z Kai would air uncut on Adult Swim's Toonami block starting in fall 2014.[6] The show began airing at 12:00 AM on November 8, 2014, replacing Bleach. Starting on February 21, 2015, a rerun of the previous weeks episode began airing at 8:00 PM on Saturdays outside of the Toonami block, with a new episode at its 12:00 AM time slot as part of Toonami.
 On December 7, 2016, it was announced via multiple media outlets that the English dub of Dragon Ball Z Kai: The Final Chapters would make its U.S. debut on Toonami on January 7, 2017 at midnight, after Dragon Ball Super.[13] The series fully completed its U.S. run on June 23, 2018.
 All the Japanese and Funimation DVD and Blu-ray releases are presented in an original 4:3 aspect ratio, although there is an option to zoom the picture to a 16:9 aspect ratio using the television remote to make it appear identical to the original Japanese broadcast.
 The uncut box set entitled Dragon Ball Z Kai Part One was released on the 18th of May 2010,[14] and Part Two was released on the 14th of September, 2010.[15]

 Super Dragon Ball Heroes ( スーパードラゴンボールヒーローズ, Sūpā Doragon Bōru Hīrōzu) is a promotional non-televised anime web series for the Dragon Ball Heroes video game that began on July 1, 2018.
 Multiple manga series are being published alongside the anime authored by Yoshitaka Nagayama.
 Reveal The anime was pre-screened for the first time in AEON LakeTown on July 1, 2018. It was streamed live on the official website on the same date. Unlike previous series, it does not air on broadcast television and airs on a sporadic schedule. However, in summer of 2020, it was revealed that the anime will have a monthly upload schedule, despite the Covid-19 pandemic.
 The first part of the series is referred to as Super Dragon Ball Heroes: Universe Mission (スーパードラゴンボール ヒーローズ: ユニバースミッション, Sūpā Doragon Bōru Hīrōzu: Yunibāsu Misshon) and is composed of the Prison Planet Saga and Universal Conflict Saga. The second part is referred to as Super Dragon Ball Heroes: Big Bang Mission (スーパードラゴンボールヒーローズ: ビッグバンミッション, Sūpā Doragon Bōru Hīrōzu: Biggu Ban Misshon) which comprises the Universe Creation Saga and New Space-Time War Saga. The third part is referred to as  Super Dragon Ball Heroes: Ultra God Mission (スーパードラゴンボールヒーローズ ウルトラゴッドミッション, Sūpā Doragon Bōru Hīrōzu: Urutora Goddo Misshon) which comprises of the Supreme Kai of Time Saga.
 For the Dragon Ball Super characters, the events take place after the Universe Survival Saga. For the ""Xeno"" characters the events occur after the Dark King Mechikabura Saga.
 Following the Tournament of Power, Goku, Vegeta and Future Mai are informed by a mysterious figure named Fu that Future Trunks is being held captive on a world called the Prison Planet, which is under control of Frieza’s brother Cooler. While there, they are confronted by the Saiyan criminal Cumber. After defeating Cumber and freeing Future Trunks, the events on Prison Planet was revealed to be conducted by the mastermind of Hearts. Hearts, who has recruited a cyborg version of Zamasu, reveal his plan to elimate Zeno and his counterpart just before destroying the Prison Planet.
 The surviving heroes safely make it back to Beerus’ world while Goku was rescued by the Grand Minister who decides to train him so that he can maintain Ultra Instinct. Hearts plants a ""universal seed"" on Universe 11 to drain its energy as he sends enemies across Universe 6 and 3. Vegeta, Trunks and the fighters of Universe 6 face against android siblings Oren and Kamin, who eventually fuse into “Kamioren” while Cooler, now transformed into “Meta Cooler”, fights against Cumber in Universe 3. The fight on Universe 6 is eventually taken to Universe 11. Goku arrives on Universe 11 with some control over Ultra Instinct. Vegeta manages to defeat Kamioren with his evolved Super Saiyan Blue. Realizing he can't defeat Hearts with Ultra Instinct, Goku convinces Vegeta to fuse with him into “Gogeta”. Gogeta, powered up to Super Saiyan Blue, delivers a final blast aimed towards the seed now infused in Heart’s chest, killing him. In his final words, Hearts explains that his true intentions were only to free all mortals from the Omni-King before congratulating Gogeta and the other fighters in defeating him. Elsewhere, a satisfied Fu declares that his next experiment is ready to begin.
 In Universe 7, Beerus warns the Z Fighters of a bird that will destroy the multiverse. Fu arrives with his evil Toki-Toki, ""Dogi-Dogi"" - the prophesied Bird of Catastrophe - and explains his plan to create an entirely new universe using the Universe Tree he planted across the multiverse that was created from Heart’s experimental universe seed and then flees back with Dogi-Dogi. The tree on Universe 7 begins weakening its inhabitants including Krillin and Piccolo. Beerus raises a shield around the Tree to drain his energy instead despite not being able to do it for long. Fu recruits villains such as Turles, Bojack, Super Android 17 and Dr. W from alternate timelines. Turles and Bojack attack Goku and Vegeta while Fu captures Toki-Toki and escapes. Elsewhere, Dr. W collects Xeno Goku and Xeno Vegeta's energy to give to Janemba, who becomes stronger. To overcome Janemba's new power, Xeno Goku and Xeno Vegeta borrow energy from their Saiyan counterparts, Xeno Trunks and Xeno Pan to achieve a new level of power to defeat Janemba. They then teleport to the site of the Universe Tree with help from Majin Salsa and Putine and Fu reveals his plan to them. Goku and Vegeta fuse into Vegito and battle Fu, while Towa reveals the truth behind Fu's existence and helps him with his plan. However, the Universe Tree is destroyed with a wish made from the Super Dragon Balls, causing Fu to use his newfound power to revive the tree while Vegito and Xeno Vegito fight against Broly, Towa and Mira with help from Demigra and Robelu. Nevertheless, Fu successfully creates a new universe but is trapped with Xeno Vegito in a Time Labyrinth by Demigra.
 Awakening in the new universe, Goku is informed by the Xenoverse fighters that he is in a duplicate of Universe 7, created by Fu. Hearts, who was bought back by Demigra from Hell, returns and proposes an alliance with Goku to defeat Fu before being attacked by Frieza and Cooler in their Golden forms. Suddenly, a Super Saiyan Broly intervenes and overpowers the four. Unbeknownst to them, a mysterious masked Saiyan watches over them while powering Frieza and Cooler with Dark Dragon Balls. However, the Dark Dragon Balls are extracted from them by another mysterious cloaked Saiyan. Hearts formulates a plan with Goku to locate the duplicate unvierse's Dragon Balls to return home. Using the duplicate universe's Dragon Radar, Goku and Hearts track one of the Dragon Balls on a nearby planet where Vegeta, Turles, and Cumber are fighting each other. Goku and Hearts arrive on the planet but Goku is confronted by the masked Saiyan, who is revealed to be Goku Black. Black transforms into Super Saiyan Rose and confronts Goku while Vegeta continues to confront Turles and Cumber. Vegeta manages to absorb Cumber's dark energy with his Super Saiyan Blue form and overpower Turles before knocking Cumber unconscious with a Galick Gun. He advises Turles to leave and train before challenging him again. Vegeta then becomes shocked to see that Black is overpowering Goku in the distance. Goku uses Ultra Instinct against Black, but the latter destroys the planet they're on. During its destruction, Cell appears to save Goku and Vegeta, who question Cell's motives which he responds to he was bought back the same reason Hearts was, who then claims he is also part of ""Majin's collaborators"".
 Big Bang Mission 
 The anime has garnished mixed reviews, with some fans saying that despite some of its good moments, the quality of the anime has ranged from decent to soulless to trying to find an identity for itself. Even though it's only aired for promotional purposes, a lot of fans (mainly those overseas) wished that it would have stuck with a better premise to begin with.
